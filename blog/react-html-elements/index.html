							for this article.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							React has become the de facto standard for web development, but
							there are still a ton of legacy codebases out there which use
							outdated frameworks like AngularJS. Moreover, there are many types
							of functionality which can most easily be implemented using React
							and its large ecosystem of libraries. As such, there are many use
							cases for embedding React components into legacy codebases. Let's
							look at how this can be achieved.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The first thing we'll do is create a new React app at the root of
							the existing repo. I'll call it "react-app", but you can of course
							name it whatever you like. You can also replace "react-ts" with
							"react" if you don't want to use TypeScript (although I strongly
							recommend using it and my examples all will). As of the time of
							writing, the script for a Vite Typescript React app is:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
npm create vite@latest react-app -- --template react-ts
            </pre>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I'm using version 6.0.5 of Vite for this demo. There may be a
							newer version available by the time you're reading this so some
							syntax may be different, but almost none of what we're doing
							relates directly to Vite.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Now that we've got our new app, cd into it and install the
							dependencies. We're ready to get started on the logic which will
							allow interoperability between the legacy codebase and our new
							React app. The main transformer is as follows:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
// react-app/src/interop/ReactElement.ts

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"

export class ReactElement extends HTMLElement {
  private mutationObserver: MutationObserver

  constructor(
    private createElement: (props: Record<&zwj;string, unknown>) => JSX.Element
  ) {
    super()

    // Re-render the component if the element's attributes change
    this.mutationObserver = new MutationObserver(() => {
      this.unmount()
      this.render()
    })
    this.mutationObserver.observe(this, { attributes: true })
  }

  // Native HTMLElement lifecycle method which runs on init
  connectedCallback() {
    this.render()
  }

  // Native HTMLElement lifecycle method which runs on destroy
  disconnectedCallback() {
    this.unmount()
    this.mutationObserver.disconnect()
  }

  private unmount() {
    createRoot(this).unmount()
  }

  private render() {
    createRoot(this).render(this.createElement(this.getProps()))
  }

  // Converts stringified kebab-case HTML attributes to parsed camelCase props
  private getProps() {
    return [...this.attributes].reduce<&zwj;Record<&zwj;string, unknown>>(
      (props, { name, value }) => {
        props[ReactElement.kebabToCamel(name)] = ReactElement.parseValue(value)
        return props
      },
      {}
    )
  }

  private static kebabToCamel(name: string) {
    return name
      .split("-")
      .map((word, i) => (i ? this.capitalize(word) : word))
      .join("")
  }

  private static parseValue(value: string): unknown {
    try {
      return JSON.parse(value)
    } catch {
      return value
    }
  }

  private static capitalize(word: string) {
    return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
  }
}
            </pre>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The gist of this class is that it creates a custom HTML element
							which is a React component under the hood. We're leveraging native
							<code>HTMLElement</code>
							lifecycle methods to mount the element and re-render if there are
							changes in its attributes. The attributes are converted from
							stringified values with kebab-case keys to parsed values with
							camelCase keys, which are passed as props to the React component
							from the createElement method which the class receives on
							initialization. ReactDOM then renders the element.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Don't worry if you don't fully understand it yet, we still have a
							few steps to go. Also, this logic is meant to be set and forget so
							it's unlikely you'll ever need to make many modifications. Okay,
							now we need to add a method to define custom HTML elements using
							our new class:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
// react-app/src/interop/defineElements.ts

import { createElement } from "react"
import { ReactElement } from "./ReactElement"

// Add components here to expose them to the legacy app,
// ensuring each includes a unique kebab-case tag
const elements: Array<&zwj;React.ElementType & { tag: string }> = []

export function defineElements() {
  for (const element of elements)
    customElements.define(
      element.tag,
      class extends ReactElement {
        constructor() {
          super(props => createElement(element, props))
        }
      }
    )
}
            </pre>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							As per the comment, any component which you want to expose as a
							custom HTML element must be added to the
							<code>elements</code> array. The
							<code>defineElements</code> function iterates over the array and
							defines each custom element, using its tag property as the custom
							element tag (hence the need to ensure it's unique and kebab-case).
							And now we just need to make a quick update to our main TS file:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
// react-app/src/main.tsx

import { StrictMode } from "react"
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"
import { defineElements } from "./interop/defineElements"

// Create custom HTML elements during build
if (import.meta.env.PROD) defineElements()
// Otherwise render the WIP component in dev mode
else
  createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
    <&zwj;StrictMode>
      <&zwj;div>
        Replace this div with the component you're currently working on. This
        will enable you to take advantage of hot reloading. Do not commit
        changes to this file. When you're ready to try your component within the
        legacy app, add it to the elements array in `interop/defineElements.ts`.
      <&zwj;/div>
    <&zwj;/StrictMode>
  )
            </pre>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Once again, the code comments sum up this logic fairly well. If
							we're in the production Node environment it means that the React
							app is being built, indicating that the legacy app is starting up
							either in development or production (since either way the React
							app needs to be built and expose the custom HTML elements the
							legacy app will include). Otherwise, we're starting up the React
							app independently for development, in which case we can add our
							WIP component and render it in strict mode with hot reloading.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							To see this all in action, let's imagine we're creating a
							dashboard (its exact contents are not relevant to this article).
							Basically it just needs to be a component with a tab property
							which is a kebab-case string. For example:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
// react-app/src/components/DashboardApp.tsx

export function DashboardApp() {
  // load data, manage state, return JSX
}

DashboardApp.tag = "dashboard-app"
            </pre>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							During development, we can add it to our
							<code>main.tsx</code> file (replacing the div from above with the
							WIP component):
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <&zwj;StrictMode>
    <&zwj;DashboardApp />
  <&zwj;/StrictMode>
)
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							This is for development purposes only and will not be committed.
							Once we're happy with our new component we can add it to the
							<code>elements</code> array in
							<code>interop/defineElements.ts</code>. This will allow the legacy
							app to import it and use it as a custom HTML element.
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
const elements: Array<&zwj;React.ElementType & { tag: string }> = [DashboardApp]
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Excellent, we're done with most of the React logic. We just need
							to make a small update to our vite.config.ts to prevent our build
							from including hashed file names:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
// react-app/vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        // By default these file names will be hashed but we
        // need them unhashed so the legacy app can import
        // them using script/link tags in its root index.html
        assetFileNames: "assets/[name].[ext]",
        chunkFileNames: "assets/[name].js",
        entryFileNames: "assets/[name].js"
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [react()]
})
            </pre>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							From here it really depends on what stack your legacy app uses,
							but in a nutshell we need to update its scripts so that prior to
							starting the development server or building the app for
							deployment, the React app is built. We also need to point the
							legacy app to the compiled JavaScript and CSS files from the
							<code>dist</code> directory.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I put this example together by cloning a sample AngularJS app and
							incorporating React into it. Here's the new script I added to its
							<code>package.json</code>:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
cd react-app && npm run build && cd .. && cpx \"react-app/dist/**/*\" app/lib/react-app -C
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Again, this runs before both the development and build scripts. It
							compiles the React code and then copies it into the (gitignored)
							<code>lib</code> directory, from which it can be accessed by the
							legacy app. In order to access it I added this to the
							<code>head</code> of the legacy app's root
							<code>index.html</code>:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
<&zwj;link href="lib/react-app/assets/index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<&zwj;script src="lib/react-app/assets/index.js"><&zwj;/script>
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							And now we can embed our custom HTML element anywhere in the
							legacy app:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
<&zwj;dashboard-app><&zwj;/dashboard-app>
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My inspiration for creating this blog post was to help other
							developers accomplish what I did in 2021 when I was tasked with
							integrating React into a legacy AngularJS app. I'll wrap up with a
							few tips based on my own experience.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Be aware that your legacy app may re-render multiple times, so if
							you're fetching data in a React component this may cause
							duplicated calls to occur. If you have some way of making your
							HTTP requests idempotent, great. If not, you may need to update
							<code>ReactElement</code> so that it doesn't render until all
							props are available.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Global styles from your legacy application will apply to your
							React app (and vice versa), although you can use a scoped approach
							like CSS Modules to avoid this. As with any app, you have the
							option of using a preprocessor like Sass or a library like MUI or
							Tailwind. It's also possible to attach a shadow DOM.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Finally, <code>@tanstack/react-query</code> can be really helpful,
							and make sure that you export a single instance of
							<code>QueryClient</code> so that all of your components will have
							access to the same context.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Technical debt is an inevitable part of the software development
							process, and developers have no control over if and when a core
							dependency of theirs is deprecated. Fortunately, we can use the
							approach laid out above to incorporate modern technologies into
							legacy applications while avoiding a costly and risky full-scale
							rewrite. Thanks for reading!
