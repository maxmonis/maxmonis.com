					<div class="blog-post-content">
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							A few weeks ago I noticed a strange state in a Next.js app router
							project I'm working on. If I opened two tabs in the same browser
							and logged into my app on one, the other would continue to show
							the sign in and sign up links in its main navbar. Similarly, if
							both had been logged in and then I signed out of one, the other's
							navbar would still display the user's handle and username until
							the page was reloaded.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I realized that I needed a way to communicate between different
							tabs in the browser, and after a little digging I found that
							<code>window.BroadcastChannel</code> was exactly what I was
							looking for. It's an API which allows scripts from the same origin
							but other browsing contexts (windows, workers) to send each other
							messages. It's not supported in IE (surprise, surprise) but has
							been supported by all major browsers for at least a few years.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Here's the first iteration of my hook:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
import * as React from "react"

export function useBroadcast(
  key: string,
  handler?: (event: MessageEvent) => void
) {
  const ref = React.useRef(new BroadcastChannel(key))

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!handler) return

    ref.current.addEventListener("message", handler)

    return () => {
      ref.current.removeEventListener("message", handler)
    }
  }, [handler, key])

  return (data: MessageEvent["data"]) => {
    ref.current.postMessage(data)
  }
}
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The key is used to create a new BroadcastChannel, and the handler
							(if one exists) is invoked whenever a message is sent on that
							channel. The hook's return value is a function which can be used
							to emit messages to the channel.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Here's an example of its usage (this component's parent is a
							server component which loads the current user and passes it as a
							prop):
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
"use client"
import * as React from "react"
import { useBroadcast } from "../hooks/useBroadcast"
import type { User } from "../utils/types"

export function UserSync(props: { user: User | null }) {
  const broadcast = useBroadcast("user", event => {
    if (event.data?.id !== props.user?.id) location.reload()
  })

  React.useEffect(() => {
    broadcast(props.user)
  }, [broadcast, props.user])

  return null
}
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							This is a fairly self-contained example of a legitimate use case.
							Every time the session changes, the new user (or null if they've
							logged out) will be broadcast. Any other tab whose user does not
							match the payload from the broadcast will simply reload, thereby
							refreshing the page to reflect the state based on the new auth
							cookie.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Our hook works, but there's definitely room for improvement.
							Passing a magic string as a key always has a strong code smell,
							and
							<code>MessageEvent["data"]</code> actually just means
							<code>any</code>. As we improve our type safety, let's imagine
							we're working for an eCommerce site and have been tasked with also
							ensuring that the cart stays synchronized between tabs. Our new
							implementation may look something like this:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
import * as React from "react"
import type { Cart, User } from "../utils/types"

export function useBroadcast<
  K extends "cart" | "user",
  T extends K extends "cart" ? Cart : User | null
>(
  key: K,
  handler?: (event: MessageEvent<&zwj;T>) => void
) {
  // same ref and useEffect as above

  return (data: T) => {
    ref.current.postMessage(data)
  }
}
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Great! Now we know that "cart" and "user" are the only valid keys,
							and that the data we send and receive will always correspond to
							the key which was used to invoke the hook. Here's how we can use
							it to keep our cart components in sync:
						</p>
						<pre class="blog-post-snippet">
// components/cart-app.tsx

"use client"
import * as React from "react"
import { useBroadcast } from "../hooks/use-broadcast"
import type { Cart } from "../utils/types"

export function CartApp(props: { cart: Cart }) {
  const [cart, setCart] = React.useState(props.cart)
  const broadcast = useBroadcast("cart", event => {
    setCart(event.data)
  })
  function handleCartUpdate(newCart: Cart) {
    setCart(newCart)
    broadcast(newCart)
  }
  // return JSX which displays cart items and allows updates
}



// components/navbar-cart-link.tsx

"use client"
import * as React from "react"
import { useBroadcast } from "../hooks/use-broadcast"

export function NavbarCartLink(props: { initialCount: number }) {
  const [itemCount, setItemCount] = React.useState(props.initialCount)
  useBroadcast("cart", event => {
    setItemCount(event.data.totalItemCount)
  })
  // return JSX with a link that shows cart item quantity
}



// components/clear-cart-button.tsx

"use client"
import { clearCart } from "../actions/clear-cart"
import { useBroadcast } from "../hooks/use-broadcast"

export function ClearCartButton() {
  const broadcast = useBroadcast("cart")
  async function handleClick() {
    const newCart = await clearCart()
    broadcast(newCart)
  }
  return <&zwj;button onClick={handleClick}>Clear Cart<&zwj;/button>
}
						</pre
						>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							In this example, CartApp displays the current items in the cart
							and allows the user to remove them or update their quantities. As
							a result, it needs to both listen for broadcasts with updated
							values and be able to send new values back to the broadcast
							channel. The useBroadcast hook is responsible for handling both of
							these tasks.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							NavbarCartLink is displayed at the top of the screen in the site's
							main navbar. As the name implies, it renders a link to the
							shopping cart page (where CartApp lives). Its CTA is a shopping
							cart icon with a number representing the total quantity of cart
							items, so this component needs to be able to receive cart
							broadcast events but never has a reason to send one.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Conversely, ClearCartButton uses a server action to clear the cart
							when clicked, after which it needs to broadcast the cleared cart
							so that the rest of the UI can be updated accordingly. However,
							this component has no need to subscribe to the broadcast channel
							since it doesn't need to know about the current state of the cart.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							And there you have it, we've ensured that the cart and user will
							always be aligned in every instance of our app within the current
							browser. As you can see, we can also use this hook to communicate
							between client components even if they don't share any common
							ancestor or context provider.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My examples used React and Next.js but
							<code>window.BroadcastChannel</code> can be used in any JavaScript
							app, you'll just need to tweak my implementation a bit. Thanks for
							reading!
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							<strong>July 3, 2025 Update:</strong>
							<br />
							Use a ref for the broadcast channel to avoid double instantiation.
