						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							One of my most concrete memories from early childhood is of a hot
							summer day when I attempted to keep up with my dad as he ran laps
							around our large rural property. I was only 5 or 6 at the time so
							my little legs couldn't match his 6'3" frame stride for stride,
							but I tried my hardest and quickly exhausted myself to the point
							of having to vomit in the bathroom as my anxious father waited
							outside the door. I distinctly remember feeling dizzy and
							marvelling at the sheer quantity of sweat that was pouring off my
							face into the porcelain bowl.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Since then I've had an on-again, off-again relationship with
							jogging, largely because until recently I had bad knees which
							would ache terribly both during and after any attempt at running.
							Fortunately, weightlifting allowed me to strengthen the connective
							tissue and surrounding musculature of these joints and thereby
							alleviate the underlying problem which had caused the pain. Having
							overcome that obstacle, I've grown to love the challenge and
							primal ephemeral qualities of pushing my body past what my
							conscious mind deems to be its limits.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I've become enamoured with the idea of mind over matter, and
							consequently intrigued by gruelling sports such as distance
							running and triathlon. I love the idea that each of us is capable
							of much more than we realize if only we can tap into our true
							potential by using an iron will to silence the little voice inside
							telling us to give up. Hearing the stories of extreme endurance
							athletes has helped feed this fire. If they can do it, then so can
							I.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							In the spring of 2019 I decided to put my mettle to the test and
							sign up for the Toronto marathon. I had a little more than a month
							to train and virtually no idea how to even begin, save for the
							understanding that I would need to run a lot. I was already strong
							and fit but had done virtually no cardiovascular training of any
							kind for over a year.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I began to run 5 km every other day, but within a week an old
							deadlifting injury in the arch of my left foot had reared its ugly
							head and forced me to walk with a limp. I kept running for another
							week or so, increasing the distance to 10 km, but the pain quickly
							became unbearable and I worried about causing structural damage
							which would prevent me from completing the actual race. I took a
							few days off to heal.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							When I resumed my training I incorporated a stretching routine
							into my regimen. I obviously should have been doing this from the
							start, but had been reticent to do so as I perceived it as somehow
							being soft and a waste of time. This had persisted despite my
							concrete knowledge to the contrary, having worked as a personal
							trainer and always insisted that clients adequately stretch prior
							to physical activity. I had one more minor flareup of the foot
							pain from then on, but it was clearly caused by overtraining on my
							part and quickly went away again.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Roughly a week before the race I went to Running Room and asked
							for a suggestion regarding footwear for marathons. I have a
							sneaking suspicion that the shoes I purchased were only
							recommended to me because they're quite ugly and seemed rather
							overpriced, but regardless they immediately proved themselves to
							be vastly superior to the hard sole sneakers I'd been training in.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I had consistently lowered my 10 km time from around an hour to
							just over 50 minutes, which seemed good to me seeing as I hoped to
							run the 42.2 km course in under four hours. I trained without
							water and at a slightly faster pace than the one I'd need to
							maintain to reach my goal, as I figured this would make it easier
							to persevere while running the longer distance on race day. I also
							stopped drinking coffee in the week leading up to the event so
							that I could consume some caffeine at the starting line and get a
							boost from it, seeing as my tolerance was low. The most fun day of
							my training was the final one, as I loaded up on protein and
							carbohydrates in the form of tacos, pho, and other tasty treats
							from my favourite local restaurants.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The race was scheduled to begin on the morning of May the 5th so I
							woke up at 5am and ate breakfast, having been fortunate enough to
							fall asleep relatively early and wake up feeling refreshed and
							energetic. I had decided against driving myself to the starting
							line in North York since that would mean having to fetch my car
							afterward and I assumed I'd be in no condition to drive. This
							premonition would later prove extremely prescient.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I hired an Uber and consumed a Clif bar, Gatorade, and as much
							water as I possibly could along the way. When we arrived I was
							struck by how chilly the weather was but also greatly invigorated
							by the nervous energy of the other participants milling around the
							starting line. I ate another Clif bar, then drank a Gatorade and a
							heavily caffeinated Starbucks brand energy drink as I waited in
							the line for the bathroom. Luckily, I was able to relieve myself
							very shortly before the race began.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I had signed up for the slowest group of runners, since I
							ultimately had no idea how quickly I was capable of running such a
							long course. This meant we started in the back and didn't even
							cross the starting line until about a minute after the gun had
							sounded. I felt extremely grateful that I'd opted not to listen to
							music or a podcast, as the sound of over a thousand people jogging
							together was unique and quite wonderful. 2000 feet hit the
							pavement at irregular intervals and I could hear the breathing and
							throat clearing of myself and those in my immediate vicinity as
							our collective breath rose like steam into the cool spring air.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The herd began to thin out as we all fell into our respective
							preferred gaits, and I found and followed the 4:00 Pace Bunny (a
							runner hired by Running Room to hold a sign and wear rabbit ears
							while maintaining a four hour pace throughout the race so as to
							help participants pace themselves). Clothing dropped along the way
							is donated to charity, so every few kilometres I shed a layer,
							starting with my jacket, then my hoodie, and finally my t-shirt.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							About a quarter of the way to the finish line I began to feel that
							the efficiency of my stride was less than optimal since I was
							attempting to match a slower pace than what I was accustomed to,
							so I sped up. This was a particularly hilly part of Yonge Street
							and I remember consciously attempting to power up the inclines and
							harness the downward slope of the declines, passing one Pace Bunny
							after another. Eventually I found myself on a sub-3:40 pace.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The sun was warm and conditions were just about perfect that
							morning. I forced myself to be present, embracing my bodily
							discomfort and soaking in the beauty of my city from this unique
							perspective. I repeated sayings to myself such as "What one man
							can do, another can do" and "Pain is temporary, your time is
							forever." I reminded myself of myriad examples of people enduring
							much more difficult things than the suffering I was experiencing.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I felt great at the halfway mark despite the pain in my lower
							extremities, but around the 25 km checkpoint doubts began to creep
							in. There were still more than 17 km to go and I had serious
							cramps in basically every muscle of both legs. I also had to stop
							to pee on a tree, disrupting my rhythm. My pace began to slow. The
							course was set up in a way that caused us to pass Exhibition Place
							(the finish line) and then have to continue along the shore of
							Lake Ontario before looping around and doubling back, which I
							found rather demoralizing compared to just continuously getting
							closer and closer to the endpoint. The breeze was very refreshing
							at least and the scenery was beautiful. People lined the sides of
							the course, holding signs and offering words of encouragement, and
							I found this helpful as well.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The final 10 km of the race were an absolute slog and I had to
							walk for about 30 seconds on roughly a dozen occasions, although I
							never stopped entirely. My body felt completely depleted and I
							couldn't stop thinking about cheeseburgers. It wasn't so much that
							my heart was pounding and I was gasping for air, it was more that
							my brain was sending me powerful urges to stop. My only desire was
							to not be running any more. I kept going.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							In the homestretch I passed a woman who had stopped to massage her
							quads and I don't know why but I yelled to her that she could do
							this. She caught up to me a few minutes later during one of my
							walking spells and shouted encouragement to me as she passed. We
							continued this pattern for the remainder of the race, urging one
							another on. I don't even know her name but it was a wonderfully
							human experience to connect in that way as we both attempted to
							achieve an incredibly difficult goal.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Three Pace Bunnies had passed me (spaced five minutes apart) so I
							knew my pace was worse than 3:50. I resolved to not allow the 3:55
							Bunny to catch up. It was disheartening to realize at the aid
							station of kilometre 42 that in addition to the water and gatorade
							held out to the participants by volunteers, there were supplements
							on the table for us to grab. To this day I wonder how much better
							my time would have been if I had realized that I could replenish
							my body's supply of carbohydrates during the race.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The finish line came into view as I crested the final hill, and
							seeing it was absolutely one of the happiest moments of my life.
							My heart broke as I passed a young woman with blood streaming down
							her leg, crying as paramedics attended to her less than 100 metres
							from the end of the race. What awful luck.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I crossed the line and slowed to a wobbly walk, taking stock for
							the first time of the pain emanating not only from my legs but
							also my shoulders and back. It didn't matter at all, I was beaming
							and almost in disbelief at having actually accomplished my goal.
							My time was three hours and 54 minutes.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I entered Exhibition Place and claimed my belongings, labouring to
							put on my orange Toronto marathon t-shirt. My best friend was
							supposed to meet me there but had had a fight with his girlfriend
							and been convinced to just head home instead. I called him, my
							mom, and numerous other friends as I ate and drank and attempted
							to regain a modicum of strength. I got two massages before
							catching the bus home, struggling immensely to climb the steps of
							the vehicle and then those of my front porch. I arduously
							undressed and took a shower. It was extremely difficult to step
							over the edge of the tub but thankfully I didn't slip. Returning
							to my room, I collapsed on my bed for an indeterminate amount of
							time, spread eagle so as not to further irritate the incredibly
							chaffed areas under my arms and between my thighs.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I went to work the next day and the four days after that, which in
							retrospect was likely unwise seeing as I had a hard time even
							stepping onto a curb. Gradually I healed, indulging for a week in
							pizza, ice cream, burgers, and all kinds of other unhealthy food
							that I normally avoid like the plague. I'd earned it.
