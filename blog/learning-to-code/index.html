              When I was 28 I ran a marathon. This came hot on the heels of my
              having bench pressed 225 pounds for the first time, and marked the
              culmination of a half decade of hard work. I had successfully
              transformed myself from an overweight slob to an extremely healthy
              fitness enthusiast, and now needed a new challenge. Nearing my
              fourth decade of life on Earth had begun to wear on me slightly,
              as I'd had numerous jobs but nothing which I would be happy doing
              long term. I wanted a career.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I happened to have recently gone on a few dates with a young woman
              who had transitioned from chemical engineering into web
              development, and the way she described her new position greatly
              intrigued me. I had lived in Northern California in my early
              twenties and knew people in the tech industry - many of whom had
              suggested that I would be good at coding - but had never really
              seriously considered it as an option.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I reached out to my cousin Ben, an experienced web developer with
              a degree in Software Engineering, and told him I was thinking of
              getting into tech. He responded enthusiastically and offered to
              mentor me throughout the learning process. His faith in me was
              invaluable, as was the knowledge that he and I are extremely
              similar in aptitude and disposition. If he could write code well,
              surely I could learn to at least do it adequately.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I began investing as much time as I possibly could into learning
              to code, starting with HTML, CSS, and computer science. I audited
              courses online, watched dozens of videos, and began to use
              Codecademy and other similar resources to get some practical
              experience. Ben and I video chatted a couple of times each week,
              allowing me the opportunity to directly ask for clarification of
              anything which was confounding me. His answers often went over my
              head, even as he attempted to dumb himself down for my benefit.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              After a few weeks I purchased a web development bootcamp on Udemy
              and began to broaden my horizons to include JavaScript and React.
              Progress was slow in coming and it always felt like the more I
              learned, the more I realized there was to learn. I knew that the
              only way was forward, gradually building my comprehension brick by
              brick. It was still difficult not to lose faith.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              An invaluable part of the learning process was the positive
              reinforcement of incrementally being able to understand more and
              more of what Ben was telling me with each passing week, and
              consistently being able to use more specific and technical
              terminology in our discussions. Equally valuable was the fact that
              every time I felt I was starting to get a handle on a technology
              or concept, I would discuss it with him and realize how far I was
              from achieving mastery. This kept me hungry.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              About three months into the process my skills had developed to the
              point where I was able to start building simple websites. I
              continued my theoretical learning but devoted most of my time to
              practical application of my burgeoning abilities. I began to
              improve by leaps and bounds in efficacy as I applied what I had
              learned in a hands-on environment. Gaps in my knowledge were
              exposed organically as I attempted to implement new features, and
              repeating simple processes solidified them in my brain.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              A few months later I began to dedicate the bulk of each day's
              programming to coding challenges which I found on various
              websites, principally Codewars. This vastly improved my ability to
              think programmatically and approach problems as an engineer.
              There's nothing quite so frustrating as being stuck on a problem,
              but also nothing quite so satisfying as figuring out its solution.
              I spent about six weeks completing over 300 challenges, which was
              tremendously fun in addition to being extremely beneficial. I've
              always loved Sudoku, and this was essentially just a different
              sort of puzzle. The difference is that nobody makes a career of
              solving Sudokus.

              I was positioned well for success when covid-19 forced us all
              indoors, having already spent a number of months alone in my room
              in front of my computer. My productivity increased exponentially
              as all other distractions in my life melted away and I completed a
              number of new projects, expanding my knowledge base all the while.
              I became the stereotypical programmer, writing code from sunup to
              sundown before signing off and realizing I'd consumed nothing all
              day save for a dozen coffees. I looked the part too, as I lost
              over 40 pounds.

            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Imposter syndrome is the sneaking suspicion that one is secretly
              incompetent and unqualified for one's work, and is omnipresent in
              the mind of virtually every single person who writes code. I am no
              exception, so one of the happiest moments of my life was when Ben
              told me that I was ready to start contributing to a professional
              codebase. His validation meant the world to me since I'm
              ultimately incapable of assessing where I stack up compared to
              other programmers. Since then I've been applying for jobs as a
              developer, having built this very website to showcase my portfolio
              of applications to prospective employers. The process has been
              long and challenging, but it'll all have been worth it once I get
              my foot in the door of the tech industry. I just need someone to
              give me a chance.

            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              My favourite part of my chosen field is that it never stops
              evolving. The status quo is frequently disrupted by brilliant
              people who invent increasingly efficient and abstract ways to
              communicate with computers. Even the best and most experienced
              programmers in the world constantly have to incorporate new tools
              and design patterns into their work, so the primary skill that
              makes them exceptional is their ability to quickly comprehend and
              internalize cutting edge concepts. I would have learned to do
              things in a radically different way if I had taught myself to code
              a decade ago, and many of the technologies I use today will be
              archaic and obsolete ten years from now. I find this incredibly
              exciting because it means that there really is no such thing as
              achieving mastery of programming, only mastery of the ability to
              learn to program. The journey is the destination, and it never
              ends. This suits me perfectly, as there's nothing I love more than
              teaching myself new things. It's the only way to grow.
