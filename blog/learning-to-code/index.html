						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							When I was 28 I ran a marathon. This came hot on the heels of my
							having bench pressed 225 pounds for the first time, and marked the
							culmination of a half decade of hard work. I had successfully
							transformed myself from an overweight slob to an extremely healthy
							fitness enthusiast, and now needed a new challenge. Nearing my
							fourth decade of life on Earth had begun to wear on me slightly,
							as I'd had numerous jobs but nothing which I would be happy doing
							long term. I wanted a career.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I happened to have recently gone on a few dates with a young woman
							who had transitioned from chemical engineering into web
							development, and the way she described her new position greatly
							intrigued me. I had lived in Northern California in my early
							twenties and knew people in the tech industry - many of whom had
							suggested that I would be good at coding - but had never really
							seriously considered it as an option.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I reached out to my cousin Ben, an experienced web developer with
							a degree in Software Engineering, and told him I was thinking of
							getting into tech. He responded enthusiastically and offered to
							mentor me throughout the learning process. His faith in me was
							invaluable, as was the knowledge that he and I are extremely
							similar in aptitude and disposition. If he could write code well,
							surely I could learn to at least do it adequately.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I began investing as much time as I possibly could into learning
							to code, starting with HTML, CSS, and computer science. I audited
							courses online, watched dozens of videos, and began to use
							Codecademy and other similar resources to get some practical
							experience. Ben and I video chatted a couple of times each week,
							allowing me the opportunity to directly ask for clarification of
							anything which was confounding me. His answers often went over my
							head, even as he attempted to dumb himself down for my benefit.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							After a few weeks I purchased a web development bootcamp on Udemy
							and began to broaden my horizons to include JavaScript and React.
							Progress was slow in coming and it always felt like the more I
							learned, the more I realized there was to learn. I knew that the
							only way was forward, gradually building my comprehension brick by
							brick. It was still difficult not to lose faith.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							An invaluable part of the learning process was the positive
							reinforcement of incrementally being able to understand more and
							more of what Ben was telling me with each passing week, and
							consistently being able to use more specific and technical
							terminology in our discussions. Equally valuable was the fact that
							every time I felt I was starting to get a handle on a technology
							or concept, I would discuss it with him and realize how far I was
							from achieving mastery. This kept me hungry.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							About three months into the process my skills had developed to the
							point where I was able to start building simple websites. I
							continued my theoretical learning but devoted most of my time to
							practical application of my burgeoning abilities. I began to
							improve by leaps and bounds in efficacy as I applied what I had
							learned in a hands-on environment. Gaps in my knowledge were
							exposed organically as I attempted to implement new features, and
							repeating simple processes solidified them in my brain.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							A few months later I began to dedicate the bulk of each day's
							programming to coding challenges which I found on various
							websites, principally Codewars. This vastly improved my ability to
							think programmatically and approach problems as an engineer.
							There's nothing quite so frustrating as being stuck on a problem,
							but also nothing quite so satisfying as figuring out its solution.
							I spent about six weeks completing over 300 challenges, which was
							tremendously fun in addition to being extremely beneficial. I've
							always loved Sudoku, and this was essentially just a different
							sort of puzzle. The difference is that nobody makes a career of
							solving Sudokus.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I was positioned well for success when covid-19 forced us all
							indoors, having already spent a number of months alone in my room
							in front of my computer. My productivity increased exponentially
							as all other distractions in my life melted away and I completed a
							number of new projects, expanding my knowledge base all the while.
							I became the stereotypical programmer, writing code from sunup to
							sundown before signing off and realizing I'd consumed nothing all
							day save for a dozen coffees. I looked the part too, as I lost
							over 40 pounds.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Imposter syndrome is the sneaking suspicion that one is secretly
							incompetent and unqualified for one's work, and is omnipresent in
							the mind of virtually every single person who writes code. I am no
							exception, so one of the happiest moments of my life was when Ben
							told me that I was ready to start contributing to a professional
							codebase. His validation meant the world to me since I'm
							ultimately incapable of assessing where I stack up compared to
							other programmers. Since then I've been applying for jobs as a
							developer, having built this very website to showcase my portfolio
							of applications to prospective employers. The process has been
							long and challenging, but it'll all have been worth it once I get
							my foot in the door of the tech industry. I just need someone to
							give me a chance.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My favourite part of my chosen field is that it never stops
							evolving. The status quo is frequently disrupted by brilliant
							people who invent increasingly efficient and abstract ways to
							communicate with computers. Even the best and most experienced
							programmers in the world constantly have to incorporate new tools
							and design patterns into their work, so the primary skill that
							makes them exceptional is their ability to quickly comprehend and
							internalize cutting edge concepts. I would have learned to do
							things in a radically different way if I had taught myself to code
							a decade ago, and many of the technologies I use today will be
							archaic and obsolete ten years from now. I find this incredibly
							exciting because it means that there really is no such thing as
							achieving mastery of programming, only mastery of the ability to
							learn to program. The journey is the destination, and it never
							ends. This suits me perfectly, as there's nothing I love more than
							teaching myself new things. It's the only way to grow.
