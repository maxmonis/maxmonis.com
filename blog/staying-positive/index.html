            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              2020 has been a challenging year. Not since the end of World War
              II in 1945 has any single event had either the scope or the impact
              of the covid-19 pandemic, let alone both. The whole world seems to
              be upside down, and most of its inhabitants are filled with a
              general sense of dread stemming from the uncertain times in which
              we find ourselves. Governmental restrictions in response to public
              health crises have left many of us without economic opportunity or
              the ability to meaningfully connect with one another, leading to
              an immeasurable increase in already alarming rates of mental
              illness and addiction issues. This has been further exacerbated by
              radical changes to society over the last two decades which have
              been fostered by rapid technological advances in the field of
              communication. The increased availability of information has been
              accompanied by commensurate dissemination of disinformation, and
              it's increasingly difficult to differentiate between the two or to
              know where to go when seeking unbiased and accurate reporting of
              current events. Political polarization and racial strife seem more
              extreme than at any time in my recollection, and it often feels
              like it's impossible to even engage in productive discourse since
              we can't consistently agree on the underlying facts of each issue.
              Fear and despair are running rampant with no end in sight,
              ravaging communities even more than the virus itself.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              All of that notwithstanding, there are real and concrete ways in
              which I've been able to help myself cope with the frustration of
              lockdown and hardship. Most can best be summed up by the well
              known prayer commonly quoted as, "God, grant me the serenity to
              accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I
              can, and wisdom to know the difference." This piece of advice has
              formed the backbone of the way I choose to live my life.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I'm unemployed and single, so it would be easy for me to focus on
              how badly I want a job and a girlfriend. Instead, I go out of my
              way to relish the autonomy granted to me by my independence. I'm
              excited for the day when I once again have someone to hold at
              night, but until then I'll never stop appreciating being able to
              spread out in bed and freely determine my own sleep schedule.
              Likewise, I'm eager to return to the structure and camaraderie of
              a workplace but am currently grateful for the flexibility I have
              with regard to my productivity. I can take breaks whenever I need
              them and choose to invest my daily hustle into any combination of
              code, music, and this blog. When inspiration strikes I'm always
              able to capitalize on it.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              With regard to both romance and my career, I ultimately have very
              little control over the timeline because so much of each depends
              on chance. Luck is what happens when preparation meets
              opportunity, so all I can do is continue to grind every single day
              so that when opportunity does knock, I'm in the best possible
              position to capitalize on it. Even without any tangible and direct
              benefit, the payoff of a long day's coding is the knowledge that
              my skillset is more complete and my portfolio will be more
              impressive to potential employers. Similarly, suffering to
              complete a challenging workout is a lot easier when I remember
              that being in better shape improves my chances of attracting the
              woman of my dreams (in addition to having immediate positive
              effects on my mental state and physical health). It's human nature
              to struggle with delayed gratification, but investing in the
              future is absolutely essential in times like these.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Staying motivated can prove challenging without any direct
              consequences for slacking off, so I've learned to limit
              distractions to the greatest extent possible in order to reduce
              the temptation of wasting days on frivolity and the mindless
              consumption of entertainment. I used to play video games and smoke
              marijuana, but luckily have aged out of enjoying either of those
              things and have never been much of a drinker. I also made the
              decision a few years ago to stop ever watching movies or TV shows
              more than once, and have been amazed at how much my creative
              output has spiked as a result. Avoiding mindless rewatching frees
              up more hours of each day (especially during quarantine, as new
              content is harder than ever to produce) and this in turn improves
              productivity. It's important to be able to destress in the evening
              by checking out and living vicariously through fictional
              characters, but too much of this good thing isn't good any more.
              For the most part, I'm able to fall asleep quickly and without
              anxious soul-searching every time I lay my head down on the pillow
              following a day in which I learned and grew and built something
              new with my own two hands. Anxiety is the feeling of excess energy
              in the body, so exhausting myself both physically and mentally is
              the only way to ensure healthy sleep. This in turn allows me to
              function at a higher level the following day and progressively
              increase my capacity in all areas. Stagnation is death, so I
              consciously choose struggle over ennui.

              Majoring in journalism at university imbued in me the deep
              understanding that bias is inherent and that media companies are
              corporations like any others - their duty is to their
              shareholders, not to their customers or any ephemeral virtue such
              as honesty. As such, it's important to remember that news agencies
              are incentivized to catastrophize and fear monger, as this has
              been proven to be an effective way of driving engagement and
              thereby increasing ad revenue. I do make an effort to stay
              apprised of the goings on of the world, but I take everything with
              a grain of salt since the sky is never really falling and the
              truth is almost always various shades of grey. There may come a
              time when it really is rational to engage in the sort of
              handwringing one encounters constantly on the news, but even if
              that is the case they've cried wolf far too many times for me to
              be able to take them at face value. Better to emotionally invest
              in my own life and those of the people around me while letting the
              minutia of current events simply fall through the cracks and melt
              into the ether. The key is that I go out of my way to remember the
              extremity of the discourse and then verify if reality lines up
              with the prognostication. It almost never does, since dire
              predictions are typically intended to build consent and reinforce
              ideological leanings rather than to objectively inform the public
              of the facts they need in order to rationally and independently
              form their own opinions. Orwell's warnings about groupthink have
              never seemed more prescient, and opting out has allowed me to feel
              much more content.

              I'm also extremely wary of social media companies, as I consider
              them to be a largely detrimental force in the global community. I
              don't have any social media apps on my phone and haven't posted
              anything at all in a number of years, although I do mindlessly
              scroll through Facebook on my computer a couple times each day. As
              a developer, I'm awed by the complexity and efficacy of the
              algorithms these leviathans use to tailor the experience of each
              user in order to maximize their engagement with the platform. As a
              human being, I'm gravely concerned about the downstream
              implications of each of us essentially living in a customized
              version of reality which prioritizes entertainment and outrage
              above all else. I have no interest in being unknowingly inducted
              into a tribe which reflexively demonizes all others, as I already
              have friends and family in the real world and I value what we have
              in common much more than the differences of opinion which make us
              unique. It's also rather troubling that if I were to measure
              myself against the online profiles of my contacts, I'd essentially
              be comparing the behind-the-scenes of my own life to their
              highlight reel. This seems a recipe for disaster, and I believe it
              to be intimately linked with the surges of discontent and
              materialistic consumerism humanity seems to be experiencing of
              late.

              I strongly believe in democracy, so I place my faith more in
              democratic institutions and the public servants which comprise
              them than in any individual politician, party, or ideology. I know
              enough to understand that I'm not equipped to determine the ideal
              outcome of any election (I frankly don't think anyone can), so I
              choose to believe in the will of the people even when it differs
              from my own preference. There seems to be a consensus that it's
              impossible to remain apolitical in such charged times as these,
              but that perception is caused by recency bias. One simply has to
              resolve to ignore propaganda and remain above the fray of partisan
              squabbling. I do vote in elections, but my emotional state is in
              no way tied to the leadership of my own region or that of any
              other. Gandhi implored us to be the change we want to see in the
              world, so I try to embody that wisdom instead of allowing my
              optimism to rely in any way on external forces.

              There is some daily variance with regard to exactly where I choose
              to invest my energy, but by the end of each week I'm slightly
              better than I was before at writing code, playing bass, and
              speaking Spanish. Taking control of my life in this way has
              allowed me to avoid feeling trapped or stagnant. I'm also
              perpetually grateful that I have many ways of keeping in touch
              with my loved ones even when we can't see each other in the flesh.
              This lockdown would have been much worse without smartphones and
              the internet; despite my previously stated reservations about the
              technological revolution, these inventions are like a knife and I
              use them as a tool instead of as a weapon. There are even some
              silver linings related to the measures we've taken to protect
              ourselves from the virus, an obvious example being that remote
              work has become more commonplace and consequently car accidents
              are down and pollution has decreased. Nothing lasts forever, and
              this too shall pass. In the meantime, all we can do is to heed the
              advice of Eric Idle and always look on the bright side of life.
