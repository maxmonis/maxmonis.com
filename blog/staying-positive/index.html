						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							2020 has been a challenging year. Not since the end of World War
							II in 1945 has any single event had either the scope or the impact
							of the covid-19 pandemic, let alone both. The whole world seems to
							be upside down, and most of its inhabitants are filled with a
							general sense of dread stemming from the uncertain times in which
							we find ourselves. Governmental restrictions in response to public
							health crises have left many of us without economic opportunity or
							the ability to meaningfully connect with one another, leading to
							an immeasurable increase in already alarming rates of mental
							illness and addiction issues. This has been further exacerbated by
							radical changes to society over the last two decades which have
							been fostered by rapid technological advances in the field of
							communication. The increased availability of information has been
							accompanied by commensurate dissemination of disinformation, and
							it's increasingly difficult to differentiate between the two or to
							know where to go when seeking unbiased and accurate reporting of
							current events. Political polarization and racial strife seem more
							extreme than at any time in my recollection, and it often feels
							like it's impossible to even engage in productive discourse since
							we can't consistently agree on the underlying facts of each issue.
							Fear and despair are running rampant with no end in sight,
							ravaging communities even more than the virus itself.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							All of that notwithstanding, there are real and concrete ways in
							which I've been able to help myself cope with the frustration of
							lockdown and hardship. Most can best be summed up by the well
							known prayer commonly quoted as, "God, grant me the serenity to
							accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I
							can, and wisdom to know the difference." This piece of advice has
							formed the backbone of the way I choose to live my life.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I'm unemployed and single, so it would be easy for me to focus on
							how badly I want a job and a girlfriend. Instead, I go out of my
							way to relish the autonomy granted to me by my independence. I'm
							excited for the day when I once again have someone to hold at
							night, but until then I'll never stop appreciating being able to
							spread out in bed and freely determine my own sleep schedule.
							Likewise, I'm eager to return to the structure and camaraderie of
							a workplace but am currently grateful for the flexibility I have
							with regard to my productivity. I can take breaks whenever I need
							them and choose to invest my daily hustle into any combination of
							code, music, and this blog. When inspiration strikes I'm always
							able to capitalize on it.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							With regard to both romance and my career, I ultimately have very
							little control over the timeline because so much of each depends
							on chance. Luck is what happens when preparation meets
							opportunity, so all I can do is continue to grind every single day
							so that when opportunity does knock, I'm in the best possible
							position to capitalize on it. Even without any tangible and direct
							benefit, the payoff of a long day's coding is the knowledge that
							my skillset is more complete and my portfolio will be more
							impressive to potential employers. Similarly, suffering to
							complete a challenging workout is a lot easier when I remember
							that being in better shape improves my chances of attracting the
							woman of my dreams (in addition to having immediate positive
							effects on my mental state and physical health). It's human nature
							to struggle with delayed gratification, but investing in the
							future is absolutely essential in times like these.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Staying motivated can prove challenging without any direct
							consequences for slacking off, so I've learned to limit
							distractions to the greatest extent possible in order to reduce
							the temptation of wasting days on frivolity and the mindless
							consumption of entertainment. I used to play video games and smoke
							marijuana, but luckily have aged out of enjoying either of those
							things and have never been much of a drinker. I also made the
							decision a few years ago to stop ever watching movies or TV shows
							more than once, and have been amazed at how much my creative
							output has spiked as a result. Avoiding mindless rewatching frees
							up more hours of each day (especially during quarantine, as new
							content is harder than ever to produce) and this in turn improves
							productivity. It's important to be able to destress in the evening
							by checking out and living vicariously through fictional
							characters, but too much of this good thing isn't good any more.
							For the most part, I'm able to fall asleep quickly and without
							anxious soul-searching every time I lay my head down on the pillow
							following a day in which I learned and grew and built something
							new with my own two hands. Anxiety is the feeling of excess energy
							in the body, so exhausting myself both physically and mentally is
							the only way to ensure healthy sleep. This in turn allows me to
							function at a higher level the following day and progressively
							increase my capacity in all areas. Stagnation is death, so I
							consciously choose struggle over ennui.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Majoring in journalism at university imbued in me the deep
							understanding that bias is inherent and that media companies are
							corporations like any others - their duty is to their
							shareholders, not to their customers or any ephemeral virtue such
							as honesty. As such, it's important to remember that news agencies
							are incentivized to catastrophize and fear monger, as this has
							been proven to be an effective way of driving engagement and
							thereby increasing ad revenue. I do make an effort to stay
							apprised of the goings on of the world, but I take everything with
							a grain of salt since the sky is never really falling and the
							truth is almost always various shades of grey. There may come a
							time when it really is rational to engage in the sort of
							handwringing one encounters constantly on the news, but even if
							that is the case they've cried wolf far too many times for me to
							be able to take them at face value. Better to emotionally invest
							in my own life and those of the people around me while letting the
							minutia of current events simply fall through the cracks and melt
							into the ether. The key is that I go out of my way to remember the
							extremity of the discourse and then verify if reality lines up
							with the prognostication. It almost never does, since dire
							predictions are typically intended to build consent and reinforce
							ideological leanings rather than to objectively inform the public
							of the facts they need in order to rationally and independently
							form their own opinions. Orwell's warnings about groupthink have
							never seemed more prescient, and opting out has allowed me to feel
							much more content.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I'm also extremely wary of social media companies, as I consider
							them to be a largely detrimental force in the global community. I
							don't have any social media apps on my phone and haven't posted
							anything at all in a number of years, although I do mindlessly
							scroll through Facebook on my computer a couple times each day. As
							a developer, I'm awed by the complexity and efficacy of the
							algorithms these leviathans use to tailor the experience of each
							user in order to maximize their engagement with the platform. As a
							human being, I'm gravely concerned about the downstream
							implications of each of us essentially living in a customized
							version of reality which prioritizes entertainment and outrage
							above all else. I have no interest in being unknowingly inducted
							into a tribe which reflexively demonizes all others, as I already
							have friends and family in the real world and I value what we have
							in common much more than the differences of opinion which make us
							unique. It's also rather troubling that if I were to measure
							myself against the online profiles of my contacts, I'd essentially
							be comparing the behind-the-scenes of my own life to their
							highlight reel. This seems a recipe for disaster, and I believe it
							to be intimately linked with the surges of discontent and
							materialistic consumerism humanity seems to be experiencing of
							late.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I strongly believe in democracy, so I place my faith more in
							democratic institutions and the public servants which comprise
							them than in any individual politician, party, or ideology. I know
							enough to understand that I'm not equipped to determine the ideal
							outcome of any election (I frankly don't think anyone can), so I
							choose to believe in the will of the people even when it differs
							from my own preference. There seems to be a consensus that it's
							impossible to remain apolitical in such charged times as these,
							but that perception is caused by recency bias. One simply has to
							resolve to ignore propaganda and remain above the fray of partisan
							squabbling. I do vote in elections, but my emotional state is in
							no way tied to the leadership of my own region or that of any
							other. Gandhi implored us to be the change we want to see in the
							world, so I try to embody that wisdom instead of allowing my
							optimism to rely in any way on external forces.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							There is some daily variance with regard to exactly where I choose
							to invest my energy, but by the end of each week I'm slightly
							better than I was before at writing code, playing bass, and
							speaking Spanish. Taking control of my life in this way has
							allowed me to avoid feeling trapped or stagnant. I'm also
							perpetually grateful that I have many ways of keeping in touch
							with my loved ones even when we can't see each other in the flesh.
							This lockdown would have been much worse without smartphones and
							the internet; despite my previously stated reservations about the
							technological revolution, these inventions are like a knife and I
							use them as a tool instead of as a weapon. There are even some
							silver linings related to the measures we've taken to protect
							ourselves from the virus, an obvious example being that remote
							work has become more commonplace and consequently car accidents
							are down and pollution has decreased. Nothing lasts forever, and
							this too shall pass. In the meantime, all we can do is to heed the
							advice of Eric Idle and always look on the bright side of life.
