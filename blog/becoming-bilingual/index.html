            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              When I was 24 I spent four months in Los Angeles, playing in
              various bands and ensembles and volunteering full-time at a
              community centre for at-risk youth in South Central. Mostly I was
              just hiding from the Canadian winter and postponing the day I'd
              have to grow up and fully abandon my dream of a career in music.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Having nearly exhausted my savings and without much earning power,
              I booked a return flight to Toronto. I was standing dejectedly in
              the security line when the pretty young lady behind me attempted
              to ask me a question in Spanish. Despite having taken Spanish 101
              in university, I was woefully incapable of either understanding or
              responding. Her English was laughably bad as well. We smiled and
              shrugged at one another.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              The gate for my flight was evidently near to hers, as she found me
              in the waiting area and sat next to me, once again attempting to
              strike up a conversation. There were almost certainly many
              bilingual people in the vicinity and I'm sure our halting
              Spanglish communication was utterly hilarious to them. I must have
              told her my surname at some point because when I got home she had
              sent me a message on Facebook in broken English (presumably
              courtesy of Google Translate) asking me to add her on Skype and
              offering to teach me Spanish in exchange for help with her
              English. We began talking every day for 30-90 minutes, relying
              heavily on online resources for assistance.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              After about a month we had become a long distance couple. It
              quickly became clear that my Spanish was improving much faster
              than her English, so we began to converse almost exclusively in
              her mother tongue. She came to visit me a few months later, and a
              couple months after that I went to live with her in Mexico for
              seven weeks. She was attending university in a rather provincial
              part of the country where almost no one spoke anything but
              Spanish, so I basically spoke zero English throughout the entire
              duration of my trip. Being forced to sink or swim allowed me to
              achieve basic fluency, albeit frequently augmented with Spanglish
              and gestures.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              At the end of my trip we decided to just be friends and I returned
              to Canada to get on with my life. Finding work as a personal
              trainer, I was lucky enough to add three Latin American clients to
              my roster, two from Mexico and the third from Costa Rica. In
              addition to completing those sessions in Spanish, I began to tutor
              a young boy whose family had recently relocated to my hometown
              from Monterrey, Mexico. He didn't speak a word of English prior to
              arrival and also had a speech impediment. Tutoring him helped me
              immensely in a number of ways, principally in that it exposed me
              to childish and esoteric words which I would otherwise have been
              unlikely to encounter in my day-to-day life. I miss the little guy
              immensely.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              After about a year I relocated to Toronto and found myself without
              anybody with whom to practice speaking, so I started reading books
              and watching movies and TV shows in Spanish. This rapidly improved
              my comprehension, and to this day I use Spanish subtitles (if
              they're available) any time I watch programming in a foreign
              language.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I was eventually lucky enough to meet a number of Venezuelan
              immigrants through random happenstance, and they invited me to a
              party. I began to spend many of my weekends at the house they
              shared in East York, immersed in heavily accented rapid-fire
              Spanish. I also stumbled upon an app called Tandem which connects
              people who are looking to learn one another's languages. I used it
              to make a couple of new friends and began to have phone
              conversations with them a few times per week, in addition to still
              occasionally communicating with my ex-girlfriend and other
              Hispanophone friends of mine.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I still have a ways to go before I'll consider myself to have
              totally achieved bilingualism. My grammar is less than perfect and
              there are many words and phrases which escape me (eg. "The grout
              isn't flush with the backsplash") but for all intents and purposes
              I'm already fluent. I had never enjoyed French in school or
              displayed any particular aptitude for foreign language
              acquisition, but have willed myself to competency because I love
              the sound of Spanish and appreciate its ever-increasing utility. I
              think I'll learn Portuguese next, it seems the most logical
              choice.
