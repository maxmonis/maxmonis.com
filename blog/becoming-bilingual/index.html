					<div class="blog-post-content">
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							When I was 24 I spent four months in Los Angeles, playing in
							various bands and ensembles and volunteering full-time at a
							community centre for at-risk youth in South Central. Mostly I was
							just hiding from the Canadian winter and postponing the day I'd
							have to grow up and fully abandon my dream of a career in music.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Having nearly exhausted my savings and without much earning power,
							I booked a return flight to Toronto. I was standing dejectedly in
							the security line when the pretty young lady behind me attempted
							to ask me a question in Spanish. Despite having taken Spanish 101
							in university, I was woefully incapable of either understanding or
							responding. Her English was laughably bad as well. We smiled and
							shrugged at one another.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The gate for my flight was evidently near to hers, as she found me
							in the waiting area and sat next to me, once again attempting to
							strike up a conversation. There were almost certainly many
							bilingual people in the vicinity and I'm sure our halting
							Spanglish communication was utterly hilarious to them. I must have
							told her my surname at some point because when I got home she had
							sent me a message on Facebook in broken English (presumably
							courtesy of Google Translate) asking me to add her on Skype and
							offering to teach me Spanish in exchange for help with her
							English. We began talking every day for 30-90 minutes, relying
							heavily on online resources for assistance.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							After about a month we had become a long distance couple. It
							quickly became clear that my Spanish was improving much faster
							than her English, so we began to converse almost exclusively in
							her mother tongue. She came to visit me a few months later, and a
							couple months after that I went to live with her in Mexico for
							seven weeks. She was attending university in a rather provincial
							part of the country where almost no one spoke anything but
							Spanish, so I basically spoke zero English throughout the entire
							duration of my trip. Being forced to sink or swim allowed me to
							achieve basic fluency, albeit frequently augmented with Spanglish
							and gestures.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							At the end of my trip we decided to just be friends and I returned
							to Canada to get on with my life. Finding work as a personal
							trainer, I was lucky enough to add three Latin American clients to
							my roster, two from Mexico and the third from Costa Rica. In
							addition to completing those sessions in Spanish, I began to tutor
							a young boy whose family had recently relocated to my hometown
							from Monterrey, Mexico. He didn't speak a word of English prior to
							arrival and also had a speech impediment. Tutoring him helped me
							immensely in a number of ways, principally in that it exposed me
							to childish and esoteric words which I would otherwise have been
							unlikely to encounter in my day-to-day life. I miss the little guy
							immensely.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							After about a year I relocated to Toronto and found myself without
							anybody with whom to practice speaking, so I started reading books
							and watching movies and TV shows in Spanish. This rapidly improved
							my comprehension, and to this day I use Spanish subtitles (if
							they're available) any time I watch programming in a foreign
							language.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I was eventually lucky enough to meet a number of Venezuelan
							immigrants through random happenstance, and they invited me to a
							party. I began to spend many of my weekends at the house they
							shared in East York, immersed in heavily accented rapid-fire
							Spanish. I also stumbled upon an app called Tandem which connects
							people who are looking to learn one another's languages. I used it
							to make a couple of new friends and began to have phone
							conversations with them a few times per week, in addition to still
							occasionally communicating with my ex-girlfriend and other
							Hispanophone friends of mine.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I still have a ways to go before I'll consider myself to have
							totally achieved bilingualism. My grammar is less than perfect and
							there are many words and phrases which escape me (eg. "The grout
							isn't flush with the backsplash") but for all intents and purposes
							I'm already fluent. I had never enjoyed French in school or
							displayed any particular aptitude for foreign language
							acquisition, but have willed myself to competency because I love
							the sound of Spanish and appreciate its ever-increasing utility. I
							think I'll learn Portuguese next, it seems the most logical
							choice.
