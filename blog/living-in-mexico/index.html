					<div class="blog-post-content">
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							On today's date in 2015 I traveled to Mexico to visit my
							girlfriend, Carolina. She and I had been in a mostly long distance
							relationship for about six months, despite meeting one another at
							a time when neither of us could speak the other's language. We'd
							fallen in love after crossing paths in LAX and then carrying on a
							month's worth of Skype conversations with the goal of teaching
							each other our respective mother tongues. She'd visited me for a
							few weeks in August and we'd been eager to reunite ever since.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							After spending Halloween with friends I took a redeye to
							Guadalajara and hired a taxi to bring me from the airport to the
							bus station. My conversation with the cabby was the first I'd ever
							had in Spanish with anyone other than Caro. I could only
							understand about half of what he said but enjoyed his thick accent
							and liberal use of the word orale, an untranslatable piece of
							Mexican slang. The best way I can describe this word to fellow
							English speakers is that it can basically mean whatever you want
							it to mean, depending on context and inflexion. Guadalajara is a
							massive and cosmopolitan city and I was grateful for the
							opportunity to travel through it without having to keep my eyes on
							the road. In many ways, it was exactly what I had expected. In
							others, it exceeded my hopes.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							As I prepared to board the bus to Tepic, the city where Carolina
							lived, I attempted to politely decline to purchase any snacks or
							beverages from the vendor positioned by the door, and was confused
							by their insistence. Luckily, another employee of the bus company
							heard my accent and came to my aid, explaining in perfect English
							that the chips and water were complimentary. I asked how he had
							come to speak my language so well and he told me that he had grown
							up in San Francisco before choosing to return to the country of
							his parents. I wondered if deportation had been involved but it
							obviously would have been rude to ask.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The journey to Tepic took roughly four hours and most of my fellow
							passengers immediately lowered their blinds and fell asleep, which
							I later came to learn is typical of Mexican bus travel. I chose
							instead to look out the window and soak in the countryside. I was
							travelling between the western Mexican states of Jalisco and
							Nayarit, both of which are located in the northernmost part of the
							Tropic of Cancer. The region is blessed with an abundance of
							natural beauty, ranging from dense jungle to sparse clusters of
							agave cacti. We passed many quaint villages which to my eye were
							as prototypically Mexican as possibly could be, with stucco
							buildings and unpaved roads. I saw horses and cattle grazing on
							inclines which seemed too steep to accommodate them, and was
							utterly blown away by the beauty of the rolling hills as we wound
							through heavily forested mountain ranges, often perilously close
							to steep cliffs.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I was unable to connect to the phone number Caro had given me, so
							when I arrived in Tepic I took a taxi to her address. No one
							answered when I knocked on the door and I began to worry that I'd
							be unable to find her. Fortunately, she was a regular at a nearby
							sushi restaurant and a waiter who knew her approached me after
							seeing me knock, confirming that I was in the right place and
							suggesting that I wait for her at the bar. She came home shortly
							thereafter, to my great relief. I had told her the wrong arrival
							time for my bus, as I was unaware that Tepic is in a different
							time zone than Guadalajara.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							That evening we dined at the sushi place. When Carolina had
							visited me in the summer she had been unimpressed with Canadian
							sushi, telling me that I simply had to try the Mexican version
							when I came to visit. To my great amusement, it turned out that
							her preferred sushi was not sushi at all, but essentially typical
							Mexican cuisine wrapped in sticky rice. I found it utterly
							disgusting, as ketchup and queso fresco are about as inauthentic
							as it gets and really do not pair well with seaweed and wasabi.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I had arrived on Día de Muertos, a holiday to commemorate and
							celebrate the dearly departed, so after dinner we headed to the
							city square to join in the festivities. It seemed as if the whole
							city had turned up, and we all moved in a throng of humanity down
							the avenue toward the cemetery. Vendors and entertainers lined the
							sides of the street and there was an electricity in the air. I
							sampled some of the carnival fare and found it utterly delicious,
							although I didn't really understand the jubilant tone of the
							holiday. At one point, Carolina pointed out a group of young men
							and told me they were mafiosos. When I asked how she knew, she
							simply replied that she's from Obregón. Lamentably, her hometown
							has long been one of the murder capitals of the world. After
							paying our respects in the graveyard (despite neither of us having
							any connection to anyone buried therein) we returned home.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							We spent the next couple weeks exploring the city together and
							hiking in the beautiful mountains which surround the Valley of
							Nayar. During dinner on my third evening in the country we heard
							an exchange of gunfire in the distance and she jokingly exclaimed,
							"¡Bienvenido a México!" It was a little disturbing how casual she
							was about the violence and crime, but obviously there's really
							nothing else to do but to try and take it in stride.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I was struck by the police presence in the city and found their
							black masks rather unnerving, although Caro mocked them as
							resembling the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I eventually came to
							understand that the masks are not meant to intimidate, but rather
							to protect the identity of the officers and hopefully reduce the
							risk of their being targeted by the cartels. They carry assault
							rifles and ride around in pickup trucks with heavy machine guns
							mounted to the back, something which one never encounters in
							Canada. One day as I walked in the street I saw a little old lady
							approach one of them and ask for directions. The officer replied
							politely and respectfully and I realized that corruption aside,
							these police are very similar to any others. They simply deal with
							a level of criminality unimaginable to citizens of countries like
							mine and have been forced to adapt their tactics accordingly.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							We had planned my visit to coincide with a school trip organized
							by Caro's anthropology class, and on the day of departure she and
							I arrived at the meeting place forty minutes late. I was sure we'd
							have missed the bus but it turned out that we were far from the
							last people to arrive. It took me a while to adjust to this
							cultural difference; when a Mexican itinerary says 2:30, it really
							means some time around 3:15. More or less.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							We slept through most of the eight hour ride to León but the sun
							came up for the last few hours and revealed to us the central
							Mexican desert. I found it interesting in that it bore absolutely
							no resemblance to any part of my native land, aside from sharing
							the flatness of the prairies. After a quick siesta in our hotel
							room we traveled the city as tourists. It was neat that Caro had
							also never been to this part of her country before, so we were
							both experiencing it for the first time. León is a remarkable
							metropolis with a distinctive and rather regal sensibility.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The following morning we rose before the sun and travelled to a
							lake on the outskirts of the city to attend the International
							Balloon Festival. Hundreds of hot air balloonists from all over
							the world travel there each year to participate, and it was a
							unique and beautiful experience to watch them all take flight over
							the water at daybreak.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							That afternoon we traveled to the city of Guanajuato to see their
							famous Museum of the Mummies. This rather strange tourist
							attraction contains the mummified victims of a nineteenth century
							cholera outbreak. We purchased candy in the shape of petrified
							humans before heading back to the hotel. The village itself is
							incredibly charming, all cobbled streets and terracotta shingles.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							On the way back north our bus stopped for an afternoon in the
							village of San Miguel de Allende, an unbelievably beautiful UNESCO
							World Heritage Site. Caro and I strolled around for hours with her
							friends before returning to the city square for a bus tour as the
							sun went down. Midway through the tour, a moustachioed man in a
							leather jacket began banging on the door of the bus. When granted
							entry, he and the driver engaged in an increasing contentious
							verbal altercation as the other passengers and I stared at the
							floor. I couldn't understand a word of what was being said and was
							admittedly more than a little concerned that we were all about to
							be kidnapped or worse. Eventually the man stormed angrily off the
							bus and the tour continued.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							A few minutes later, a police car with lights flashing cut off the
							bus and another pulled up behind us. The moustachioed man jumped
							out and again embarked onto the bus while yelling at the driver.
							Carolina said something to the two of them and everybody on the
							bus seemed to agree with whatever it was. We all began to file off
							the bus and the man pulled out a massive wad of bills, handing
							money to us as we left. At the time I had absolutely no idea what
							had happened but I later learned that the man was the owner of the
							tour company and the driver was his son, who had snuck the bus out
							in order to make extra money on the side. The owner was furious
							about this and refunded our money to us by way of apology.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							After another week or two enjoying domestic life in Tepic, Caro
							and I took a bus to Puerto Vallarta, a small beachfront city
							located south of Tepic, to visit her friend Hugo. He worked as a
							tour guide and as such was the first person I'd encountered in a
							month with whom I was able to converse in English. He proved to be
							one of the coolest people I've ever met, super mellow and
							sincerely passionate about nature and conservation. His house was
							located midway up a jungle-covered mountain overlooking the city
							and the sea, and his third story bedroom had curtains and a
							wrought iron railing in lieu of walls. Truly one of the most
							magical places I've ever visited.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Carolina's best friend, Diana, was in Puerto Vallarta for a
							conference, so the four of us spent a few days together. The city
							is reminiscent of a seaside town in the south of Europe and I've
							never swam in warmer ocean water. Caro didn't know how to swim and
							nearly drowned me as I attempted to teach her, which was
							incredibly cute despite how red my eyes got. As we prepared to
							return from the beach I asked if it was okay for me to get on a
							bus with an open beer while soaking wet and shirtless, and my
							Mexican companions looked at me as if I had two heads. Of course
							it was, in Mexico you're free.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Before heading home, Caro and I took advantage of the fact that
							I'm a gringo (although some Mexicans would assert that I'm not,
							seeing as only Americans are gringos) and snuck onto the private
							beach of a fancy hotel by casually strolling through the lobby as
							I spoke to her in English and she pretended to understand. It was
							one of the most serene afternoons of my trip. My Spanish was
							finally improving to the point where I was able to communicate
							freely with the woman I loved without relying on the assistance of
							a computer or smartphone.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							It occurs to me that I've thus far neglected to describe our
							living conditions in Tepic. We were staying in a second floor
							apartment which Carolina shared with her two roommates, an engaged
							couple named Stephanie and Aldo. The two of them lived in a
							separate domicile located on the other side of a small courtyard,
							although we all shared the living room, bathroom, and kitchen of
							the main apartment. Midway through my stay, Stephanie's mother
							dropped off her chihuahua, Taquito, so that we could look after
							him while she travelled. I despised that dog, he was an irritating
							little pest with absolutely no redeeming qualities.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Caro's apartment was distinct from Canadian ones in that the
							washer and dryer were located outdoors, and that in order to get
							hot water we had to start a little boiler to heat up the rainwater
							which collected in a basin on the roof. I once forgot to turn it
							off, causing all the water to evaporate. We had to shower at a
							neighbourhood hotel for a few days before a rainstorm replenished
							our supply. Also, as is common in Latin America, we could never
							flush toilet paper and instead had to discard it in a wastepaper
							basket next to the toilet. That is likely my least favourite thing
							about Mexico.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Many of my friends and family had warned me prior to my trip that
							I would likely experience intense gastrointestinal distress while
							south of the border (or, more accurately seeing as I'm from
							Canada, south of two borders) but I didn't have any issues at all
							and the food was utterly delicious everywhere we ate. Our
							favourite restaurant was a vegan spot popular among the college
							crowd. It was called the Burrito Piñata and the decor was designed
							to create the impression that one was indeed inside a piñata in
							the shape of a donkey. The gimmick was that there were no fixed
							prices, patrons could simply pay whatever they deemed the meal to
							have been worth. I was pretty carnivorous at the time but
							absolutely loved that place. It surely helped that Caro and I
							constantly smoked copious amounts of marijuana, which cost less
							than a dollar per gram. We had to travel to a pretty sketchy part
							of town to get it, literally crossing train tracks into a seedy
							neighbourhood with stray dogs and chickens running around dirt
							roads, but at that price it's hard to complain.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Even when we were eating at home, the food was incredible. Caro
							did all the cooking, and I did all the shopping and cleaning. Home
							cooked Mexican food is super tasty, especially when you have fresh
							tortillas and high quality produce. Nayarit is a largely
							agricultural state, so inexpensive and fresh vegetables are always
							readily available at corner stores. The grocers fill your bag for
							you as you tell them what you want, which proved to be an
							excellent way for me to learn the words for onion, avocado, and so
							on. As an aside, the English word for avocado greatly resembles
							the Spanish word for lawyer, so I once accidentally suggested to
							Caro that we get some lawyers and chop them up to eat with our
							quesadillas.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Getting around Tepic is remarkably easy. In addition to a
							comprehensive bus system, there is a network of vans know as
							combis which are incredibly inexpensive and are essentially a
							hybrid between a taxi and a bus. They pick people up like a bus
							and then follow a general route which they alter to accommodate
							their passengers. Additionally, taxis in Tepic are unbelievably
							cheap. Travelling just about anywhere costs 30 pesos, which is
							roughly three dollars. I assume there's some sort of subsidy in
							place from the municipal government because otherwise that doesn't
							even seem to be enough money to cover the gas. I became so
							acclimated to this pricing that I once haggled angrily with a
							cabby who attempted to charge me 100 pesos for an hour long ride,
							before later realizing that in Canada the price would have been at
							least 10 times higher. It was the principle that irked me more
							than anything, as he clearly was only gouging me like that because
							he'd heard my accent. Caro had implored me never to speak while we
							rode in a taxi so the driver wouldn't realize I was foreign.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I was in Mexico for two parades, one on Revolution Day and the
							other in anticipation of Christmas. Both were radically different
							from any parade I'd seen before, despite featuring the typical
							marching bands, acrobats, and floats. The final half hour of the
							Revolution Day parade was essentially a show of force by the local
							police, who rolled out all of their vehicles and weapons and
							marched proudly down the avenue. It culminated in a number of them
							joining together in a kind of human pyramid spread across the back
							of several trucks, which the crowd applauded politely. The
							Christmas parade was odd in that it was entirely sponsored by
							Coca-Cola, and just that one detail is enough for you to
							understand exactly what I mean.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The final major excursion of my visit was to Guadalajara. We
							arrived without having booked accommodations, and Caro literally
							went around asking random pedestrians if they knew of a good place
							for us to stay. Eventually a woman not only made a recommendation
							but also drove us across town to the hotel. Canadians have a
							reputation for being nice, but I think it's more accurate to say
							that we're meek and polite. Mexicans are the nicest people on
							Earth.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							We spent our days sightseeing and our nights partying in bars and
							nightclubs. The highlights of the trip were an open double decker
							bus tour during which I became almost impossibly sunburned, and a
							horse drawn carriage ride around the historic city centre at
							sunset. We had planned to tour distilleries in the city of Tequila
							on our way home, but by that time were too exhausted. I love
							Guadalajara, its architecture is magnificent and it has the same
							ineffable vibrant qualities as all major cities I've visited in my
							life, along with the same amenities.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							With my imminent departure looming, Carolina and I had to have a
							difficult discussion. She was pursuing her degree in psychology
							and I needed to find a career in Canada, but neither of us was
							enthusiastic about the prospect of going back to a long distance
							relationship. Living in different countries and time zones had
							proven extremely challenging for obvious reasons, especially when
							contrasted with the more traditional relationship we had now
							experienced. We decided it was better to be friends, which we
							still are to this day. She's one of my favourite people and I'll
							always cherish the seven weeks we spent together in her beloved
							Mexico.
