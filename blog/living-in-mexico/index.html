            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              On today's date in 2015 I traveled to Mexico to visit my
              girlfriend, Carolina. She and I had been in a mostly long distance
              relationship for about six months, despite meeting one another at
              a time when neither of us could speak the other's language. We'd
              fallen in love after crossing paths in LAX and then carrying on a
              month's worth of Skype conversations with the goal of teaching
              each other our respective mother tongues. She'd visited me for a
              few weeks in August and we'd been eager to reunite ever since.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              After spending Halloween with friends I took a redeye to
              Guadalajara and hired a taxi to bring me from the airport to the
              bus station. My conversation with the cabby was the first I'd ever
              had in Spanish with anyone other than Caro. I could only
              understand about half of what he said but enjoyed his thick accent
              and liberal use of the word orale, an untranslatable piece of
              Mexican slang. The best way I can describe this word to fellow
              English speakers is that it can basically mean whatever you want
              it to mean, depending on context and inflexion. Guadalajara is a
              massive and cosmopolitan city and I was grateful for the
              opportunity to travel through it without having to keep my eyes on
              the road. In many ways, it was exactly what I had expected. In
              others, it exceeded my hopes.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              As I prepared to board the bus to Tepic, the city where Carolina
              lived, I attempted to politely decline to purchase any snacks or
              beverages from the vendor positioned by the door, and was confused
              by their insistence. Luckily, another employee of the bus company
              heard my accent and came to my aid, explaining in perfect English
              that the chips and water were complimentary. I asked how he had
              come to speak my language so well and he told me that he had grown
              up in San Francisco before choosing to return to the country of
              his parents. I wondered if deportation had been involved but it
              obviously would have been rude to ask.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              The journey to Tepic took roughly four hours and most of my fellow
              passengers immediately lowered their blinds and fell asleep, which
              I later came to learn is typical of Mexican bus travel. I chose
              instead to look out the window and soak in the countryside. I was
              travelling between the western Mexican states of Jalisco and
              Nayarit, both of which are located in the northernmost part of the
              Tropic of Cancer. The region is blessed with an abundance of
              natural beauty, ranging from dense jungle to sparse clusters of
              agave cacti. We passed many quaint villages which to my eye were
              as prototypically Mexican as possibly could be, with stucco
              buildings and unpaved roads. I saw horses and cattle grazing on
              inclines which seemed too steep to accommodate them, and was
              utterly blown away by the beauty of the rolling hills as we wound
              through heavily forested mountain ranges, often perilously close
              to steep cliffs.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I was unable to connect to the phone number Caro had given me, so
              when I arrived in Tepic I took a taxi to her address. No one
              answered when I knocked on the door and I began to worry that I'd
              be unable to find her. Fortunately, she was a regular at a nearby
              sushi restaurant and a waiter who knew her approached me after
              seeing me knock, confirming that I was in the right place and
              suggesting that I wait for her at the bar. She came home shortly
              thereafter, to my great relief. I had told her the wrong arrival
              time for my bus, as I was unaware that Tepic is in a different
              time zone than Guadalajara.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              That evening we dined at the sushi place. When Carolina had
              visited me in the summer she had been unimpressed with Canadian
              sushi, telling me that I simply had to try the Mexican version
              when I came to visit. To my great amusement, it turned out that
              her preferred sushi was not sushi at all, but essentially typical
              Mexican cuisine wrapped in sticky rice. I found it utterly
              disgusting, as ketchup and queso fresco are about as inauthentic
              as it gets and really do not pair well with seaweed and wasabi.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I had arrived on Día de Muertos, a holiday to commemorate and
              celebrate the dearly departed, so after dinner we headed to the
              city square to join in the festivities. It seemed as if the whole
              city had turned up, and we all moved in a throng of humanity down
              the avenue toward the cemetery. Vendors and entertainers lined the
              sides of the street and there was an electricity in the air. I
              sampled some of the carnival fare and found it utterly delicious,
              although I didn't really understand the jubilant tone of the
              holiday. At one point, Carolina pointed out a group of young men
              and told me they were mafiosos. When I asked how she knew, she
              simply replied that she's from Obregón. Lamentably, her hometown
              has long been one of the murder capitals of the world. After
              paying our respects in the graveyard (despite neither of us having
              any connection to anyone buried therein) we returned home.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              We spent the next couple weeks exploring the city together and
              hiking in the beautiful mountains which surround the Valley of
              Nayar. During dinner on my third evening in the country we heard
              an exchange of gunfire in the distance and she jokingly exclaimed,
              "¡Bienvenido a México!" It was a little disturbing how casual she
              was about the violence and crime, but obviously there's really
              nothing else to do but to try and take it in stride.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              I was struck by the police presence in the city and found their
              black masks rather unnerving, although Caro mocked them as
              resembling the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I eventually came to
              understand that the masks are not meant to intimidate, but rather
              to protect the identity of the officers and hopefully reduce the
              risk of their being targeted by the cartels. They carry assault
              rifles and ride around in pickup trucks with heavy machine guns
              mounted to the back, something which one never encounters in
              Canada. One day as I walked in the street I saw a little old lady
              approach one of them and ask for directions. The officer replied
              politely and respectfully and I realized that corruption aside,
              these police are very similar to any others. They simply deal with
              a level of criminality unimaginable to citizens of countries like
              mine and have been forced to adapt their tactics accordingly.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              We had planned my visit to coincide with a school trip organized
              by Caro's anthropology class, and on the day of departure she and
              I arrived at the meeting place forty minutes late. I was sure we'd
              have missed the bus but it turned out that we were far from the
              last people to arrive. It took me a while to adjust to this
              cultural difference; when a Mexican itinerary says 2:30, it really
              means some time around 3:15. More or less.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              We slept through most of the eight hour ride to León but the sun
              came up for the last few hours and revealed to us the central
              Mexican desert. I found it interesting in that it bore absolutely
              no resemblance to any part of my native land, aside from sharing
              the flatness of the prairies. After a quick siesta in our hotel
              room we traveled the city as tourists. It was neat that Caro had
              also never been to this part of her country before, so we were
              both experiencing it for the first time. León is a remarkable
              metropolis with a distinctive and rather regal sensibility.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              The following morning we rose before the sun and travelled to a
              lake on the outskirts of the city to attend the International
              Balloon Festival. Hundreds of hot air balloonists from all over
              the world travel there each year to participate, and it was a
              unique and beautiful experience to watch them all take flight over
              the water at daybreak.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              That afternoon we traveled to the city of Guanajuato to see their
              famous Museum of the Mummies. This rather strange tourist
              attraction contains the mummified victims of a nineteenth century
              cholera outbreak. We purchased candy in the shape of petrified
              humans before heading back to the hotel. The village itself is
              incredibly charming, all cobbled streets and terracotta shingles.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              On the way back north our bus stopped for an afternoon in the
              village of San Miguel de Allende, an unbelievably beautiful UNESCO
              World Heritage Site. Caro and I strolled around for hours with her
              friends before returning to the city square for a bus tour as the
              sun went down. Midway through the tour, a moustachioed man in a
              leather jacket began banging on the door of the bus. When granted
              entry, he and the driver engaged in an increasing contentious
              verbal altercation as the other passengers and I stared at the
              floor. I couldn't understand a word of what was being said and was
              admittedly more than a little concerned that we were all about to
              be kidnapped or worse. Eventually the man stormed angrily off the
              bus and the tour continued.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              A few minutes later, a police car with lights flashing cut off the
              bus and another pulled up behind us. The moustachioed man jumped
              out and again embarked onto the bus while yelling at the driver.
              Carolina said something to the two of them and everybody on the
              bus seemed to agree with whatever it was. We all began to file off
              the bus and the man pulled out a massive wad of bills, handing
              money to us as we left. At the time I had absolutely no idea what
              had happened but I later learned that the man was the owner of the
              tour company and the driver was his son, who had snuck the bus out
              in order to make extra money on the side. The owner was furious
              about this and refunded our money to us by way of apology.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              After another week or two enjoying domestic life in Tepic, Caro
              and I took a bus to Puerto Vallarta, a small beachfront city
              located south of Tepic, to visit her friend Hugo. He worked as a
              tour guide and as such was the first person I'd encountered in a
              month with whom I was able to converse in English. He proved to be
              one of the coolest people I've ever met, super mellow and
              sincerely passionate about nature and conservation. His house was
              located midway up a jungle-covered mountain overlooking the city
              and the sea, and his third story bedroom had curtains and a
              wrought iron railing in lieu of walls. Truly one of the most
              magical places I've ever visited.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Carolina's best friend, Diana, was in Puerto Vallarta for a
              conference, so the four of us spent a few days together. The city
              is reminiscent of a seaside town in the south of Europe and I've
              never swam in warmer ocean water. Caro didn't know how to swim and
              nearly drowned me as I attempted to teach her, which was
              incredibly cute despite how red my eyes got. As we prepared to
              return from the beach I asked if it was okay for me to get on a
              bus with an open beer while soaking wet and shirtless, and my
              Mexican companions looked at me as if I had two heads. Of course
              it was, in Mexico you're free.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Before heading home, Caro and I took advantage of the fact that
              I'm a gringo (although some Mexicans would assert that I'm not,
              seeing as only Americans are gringos) and snuck onto the private
              beach of a fancy hotel by casually strolling through the lobby as
              I spoke to her in English and she pretended to understand. It was
              one of the most serene afternoons of my trip. My Spanish was
              finally improving to the point where I was able to communicate
              freely with the woman I loved without relying on the assistance of
              a computer or smartphone.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              It occurs to me that I've thus far neglected to describe our
              living conditions in Tepic. We were staying in a second floor
              apartment which Carolina shared with her two roommates, an engaged
              couple named Stephanie and Aldo. The two of them lived in a
              separate domicile located on the other side of a small courtyard,
              although we all shared the living room, bathroom, and kitchen of
              the main apartment. Midway through my stay, Stephanie's mother
              dropped off her chihuahua, Taquito, so that we could look after
              him while she travelled. I despised that dog, he was an irritating
              little pest with absolutely no redeeming qualities.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Caro's apartment was distinct from Canadian ones in that the
              washer and dryer were located outdoors, and that in order to get
              hot water we had to start a little boiler to heat up the rainwater
              which collected in a basin on the roof. I once forgot to turn it
              off, causing all the water to evaporate. We had to shower at a
              neighbourhood hotel for a few days before a rainstorm replenished
              our supply. Also, as is common in Latin America, we could never
              flush toilet paper and instead had to discard it in a wastepaper
              basket next to the toilet. That is likely my least favourite thing
              about Mexico.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Many of my friends and family had warned me prior to my trip that
              I would likely experience intense gastrointestinal distress while
              south of the border (or, more accurately seeing as I'm from
              Canada, south of two borders) but I didn't have any issues at all
              and the food was utterly delicious everywhere we ate. Our
              favourite restaurant was a vegan spot popular among the college
              crowd. It was called the Burrito Piñata and the decor was designed
              to create the impression that one was indeed inside a piñata in
              the shape of a donkey. The gimmick was that there were no fixed
              prices, patrons could simply pay whatever they deemed the meal to
              have been worth. I was pretty carnivorous at the time but
              absolutely loved that place. It surely helped that Caro and I
              constantly smoked copious amounts of marijuana, which cost less
              than a dollar per gram. We had to travel to a pretty sketchy part
              of town to get it, literally crossing train tracks into a seedy
              neighbourhood with stray dogs and chickens running around dirt
              roads, but at that price it's hard to complain.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Even when we were eating at home, the food was incredible. Caro
              did all the cooking, and I did all the shopping and cleaning. Home
              cooked Mexican food is super tasty, especially when you have fresh
              tortillas and high quality produce. Nayarit is a largely
              agricultural state, so inexpensive and fresh vegetables are always
              readily available at corner stores. The grocers fill your bag for
              you as you tell them what you want, which proved to be an
              excellent way for me to learn the words for onion, avocado, and so
              on. As an aside, the English word for avocado greatly resembles
              the Spanish word for lawyer, so I once accidentally suggested to
              Caro that we get some lawyers and chop them up to eat with our
              quesadillas.

              Getting around Tepic is remarkably easy. In addition to a
              comprehensive bus system, there is a network of vans know as
              combis which are incredibly inexpensive and are essentially a
              hybrid between a taxi and a bus. They pick people up like a bus
              and then follow a general route which they alter to accommodate
              their passengers. Additionally, taxis in Tepic are unbelievably
              cheap. Travelling just about anywhere costs 30 pesos, which is
              roughly three dollars. I assume there's some sort of subsidy in
              place from the municipal government because otherwise that doesn't
              even seem to be enough money to cover the gas. I became so
              acclimated to this pricing that I once haggled angrily with a
              cabby who attempted to charge me 100 pesos for an hour long ride,
              before later realizing that in Canada the price would have been at
              least 10 times higher. It was the principle that irked me more
              than anything, as he clearly was only gouging me like that because
              he'd heard my accent. Caro had implored me never to speak while we
              rode in a taxi so the driver wouldn't realize I was foreign.

              I was in Mexico for two parades, one on Revolution Day and the
              other in anticipation of Christmas. Both were radically different
              from any parade I'd seen before, despite featuring the typical
              marching bands, acrobats, and floats. The final half hour of the
              Revolution Day parade was essentially a show of force by the local
              police, who rolled out all of their vehicles and weapons and
              marched proudly down the avenue. It culminated in a number of them
              joining together in a kind of human pyramid spread across the back
              of several trucks, which the crowd applauded politely. The
              Christmas parade was odd in that it was entirely sponsored by
              Coca-Cola, and just that one detail is enough for you to
              understand exactly what I mean.

              The final major excursion of my visit was to Guadalajara. We
              arrived without having booked accommodations, and Caro literally
              went around asking random pedestrians if they knew of a good place
              for us to stay. Eventually a woman not only made a recommendation
              but also drove us across town to the hotel. Canadians have a
              reputation for being nice, but I think it's more accurate to say
              that we're meek and polite. Mexicans are the nicest people on
              Earth.

              We spent our days sightseeing and our nights partying in bars and
              nightclubs. The highlights of the trip were an open double decker
              bus tour during which I became almost impossibly sunburned, and a
              horse drawn carriage ride around the historic city centre at
              sunset. We had planned to tour distilleries in the city of Tequila
              on our way home, but by that time were too exhausted. I love
              Guadalajara, its architecture is magnificent and it has the same
              ineffable vibrant qualities as all major cities I've visited in my
              life, along with the same amenities.

              With my imminent departure looming, Carolina and I had to have a
              difficult discussion. She was pursuing her degree in psychology
              and I needed to find a career in Canada, but neither of us was
              enthusiastic about the prospect of going back to a long distance
              relationship. Living in different countries and time zones had
              proven extremely challenging for obvious reasons, especially when
              contrasted with the more traditional relationship we had now
              experienced. We decided it was better to be friends, which we
              still are to this day. She's one of my favourite people and I'll
              always cherish the seven weeks we spent together in her beloved
              Mexico.
