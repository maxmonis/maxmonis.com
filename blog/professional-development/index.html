					<div class="blog-post-content">
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I began programming in my spare time in the spring of 2019. I had
							been working as a personal trainer for a few years, so naturally
							the first website I decided to build was a fitness app which could
							not only track workouts but also recommend new ones. This initial
							scope was way beyond anything I could achieve at the time, and
							this quickly became clear as I worked on it (not only due to my
							inexperience but also because recommending workouts would require
							AI).
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Over the next year I created increasingly complex iterations of my
							workout tracker but was stuck in what is commonly referred to as
							tutorial hell. Despite reading constantly, watching tons of
							videos, and completing numerous courses, I remained unable to
							really apply what I was learning and unaware that this was the
							case. A breakthrough occurred in the summer of 2020 when I
							purchased a Spanish language programming course and decided that
							instead of simply following along with the instructor, I would
							translate both the code and the UI to English in real time. This
							forced me to debug issues which arose from the translation process
							without the safety net of being able to simply find the correct
							code in the video or the accompanying repo.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The culminating activity of the course was a clone of Product
							Hunt, and I realized that I could alter the basic structure of
							this app to create a project I'd had in mind for a while: a social
							media site for sharing solutions to programming challenges. I'd
							been grinding LeetCode and Codewars for months, so this new app
							would provide me with both a new portfolio project and a way to
							showcase my coding skills to potential employers. It took me less
							than a month to finish, and is still featured on my portfolio (the
							original version of which was also based on a project from the
							same course). I began blogging as well, publishing a new article
							each Saturday throughout the fall.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I landed my first job as a web developer in November 2020, almost
							exactly eighteen months after I wrote my first lines of code. Like
							many companies, the startup which hired me had received an influx
							of capital during covid, meaning they'd expanded from roughly five
							permanent employees to a dozen (I was the twelfth). There was only
							one other frontend dev at the company, an international contractor
							named Filipe. It became apparent almost immediately that he did
							very little work, but he was able to provide guidance when I
							needed it.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							An advertising management platform called AdButler had recently
							been incorporated into the eCommerce modules of the app, and the
							very first ticket I was assigned was to add keywords to its
							requests to help display targeted ads to individual users. I
							thought I'd done a good job on it, but then in a meeting with the
							entire engineering department my boss pointed out that I'd
							misunderstood the requirements. He then proceeded to rewrite
							everything I'd done over the past week in about five minutes,
							despite not knowing JavaScript. This was certainly a rude
							awakening for me, and to be honest I was more than a little
							concerned that I'd be let go for incompetence.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Fortunately, the next task I undertook was to localize the entire
							site into French. It was not very technically challenging,
							allowing me to focus more on gitflow and learning about the
							structure of the app. The codebase used Angular.js and es5, and
							this was quite an adjustment for me after always using React and
							es6+ during the learning process. The QA team and I used
							spreadsheets to verify that translations were comprehensive and
							accurate, and it was during this time that I began to really take
							stock of how unreliable and unproductive Filipe was, as he was
							frequently AWOL and I wound up having to do the overwhelming
							majority of the work. At the time I was unsure if he had other
							responsibilities of which I was unaware, since otherwise it was
							astonishing that any professional would conduct themselves in this
							way.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I was then tasked with creating a new page known as the Product
							Details Page, or PDP for short. It had complicated requirements
							including intricate responsiveness, so it was quite a challenge
							for someone as green as I was. Fortunately, the designer and
							product manager were both easy to work with and we met frequently
							to ensure we were aligned and all of our decisions were well
							documented. Once again, Filipe no-showed most meetings and the
							small amount of code he contributed was of very poor quality. From
							then on I always attempted to take full ownership of whatever
							needed to be worked on, since otherwise it felt like a school
							project where I did almost all the work but we both got an A.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Next up were several redesigns of existing widgets, since the app
							had never been responsive. I remember being asked to hop on a call
							with the product team, wherein the CEO asked if the new product
							cards which I'd built could be incorporated globally instead of
							just in the one section which had been specified. I felt immense
							pride as I assured him that I'd intentionally built them in a
							modular way in case we ever wanted to reuse them elsewhere, and
							shared my screen to demonstrate this to the team. It was at this
							point that I knew I was a real developer, although of course bouts
							of imposter syndrome would continue to crop up from time to time.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Converting the inventory filters widget from a persistent modal to
							a toggleable slideout proved to be shockingly challenging since
							the widget was generated by third party software, and I needed to
							perform a lot of CSS sleight of hand to make it look like the
							specs. It was also the first time I'd had a legitimate use case
							within an SPA for traditional JavaScript like querySelector. I
							realized that my beliefs about code quality and best practices
							would sometimes need to be overridden for the sake of getting the
							job done.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							As I worked on a new feature which would allow some products to be
							formularies with no price, I began to fully grasp the value of
							comments in production codebases. I'd always felt that good code
							is self documenting, but for this particular feature there were
							many ways in which even good variable and function names would not
							convey the necessary meaning to future maintainers. This was
							further reinforced the following month when we landed a government
							contract to distribute free masks and covid tests to medical
							practitioners (since there were now multiple scenarios in which a
							price could be null or 0, which the previous implementation had
							always forbidden). We had to work around existing constraints, so
							it was important not to allow perfect to be the enemy of good, and
							to clearly explain why certain hacky choices had to be made. We
							also needed to update JSON responses to include new quantity
							restriction properties, and this was the first time I'd been
							directly involved in discussions around API architecture.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The CTO was always reticent to rewrite existing code, but was
							eventually convinced by the designer that we needed to redo the
							Order Details Page, one of the most crucial parts of the checkout
							flow. It was meant to be a coat of paint which would ensure
							responsiveness and consistency with our new design system, and our
							main concern was to avoid regressions. I spent nearly a month on
							the code, and it passed QA with minimal reopens. On the first
							morning after deploying the new build to production, Slack began
							to blow up with message after message from customer support. Our
							users were unable to place their orders.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							What had happened was that the redesign included a new form
							prompting the user to add a credit card if they didn't have one on
							file. This form was only visible if the order in question included
							a vendor who billed by credit card instead of through EDI. Most of
							our users (>95%) did not have a credit card on file since they
							were not signed up for SaaS products and were merely using our
							marketplace. This meant that the credit card form was triggered
							and the checkout button was disabled. However, since there was no
							credit card vendor in their order, the form was not visible.
							Throughout all of our testing, no one had thought to try to check
							out using a non-premium account. I was able to quickly track down
							the bug and fix it, and we pushed a hotfix within about twenty
							minutes. This was the first major issue I had directly caused, and
							it was a harrowing experience. From then on I would allude back to
							the Order Details Page updates any time I wanted to express my
							reservations about a proposed change due to its inherent unknown
							risks.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Up to this point the codebase had never included any form of
							tests, so we integrated Karma and Jasmine and I started creating
							test suites. At the time none of us had any idea about how to
							write valuable tests, and the first attempts I made were laughably
							bad in retrospect. However, I improved with each new feature and
							within a few months was writing tests which did add value to the
							codebase and increase our confidence in it.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							As I wrapped up my first year at Sowingo I was tasked with
							updating the inventory section to allow users to set an optional
							desired level and minimum level for each product. This stands out
							as the feature with the largest disparity between our initial
							assessment of the level of complexity and the actual amount of
							collaboration and iteration which was required. It seemed that at
							least once per day some combination of myself, the product
							manager, and the assigned backend dev would have to regroup in
							order to discuss some unforeseen complication. This went on for
							nearly three weeks, although our initial assessment had been that
							it would only take a few days to complete. Once we finally pushed
							a build to staging, QA began to discover other edge cases which
							we'd overlooked.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Having learned from our experience, we did a tremendous job of
							planning out the next feature we worked on. It was a system which
							allowed admin users to approve or deny marketplace orders and
							purchase orders created by their subordinates, and was by far the
							most well organized feature we ever built. Unfortunately, it never
							actually wound up being rolled out to real users, but it was still
							a tremendous example of how planning and communicating during the
							early stages of feature creation can save a lot of headaches and
							backtracking in the future.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My next major task was updating the way billing information was
							stored. We needed a secure solution for storing sensitive credit
							card information and after some due diligence decided to use a new
							tool called Skyflow. This was one of the first times that I needed
							to read and deeply understand third party documentation, which
							made me feel more like an engineer and less like a coder. I also
							needed to work closely with the lead backend engineer because
							there were a large number of edge cases which we had to handle
							gracefully. Creating UMLs and flow charts proved incredibly
							valuable.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							In March of 2022 I took my first vacation, and during that week
							off I created the POC of a new project I'd been wanting to build
							for some time: a website which would allow users to vote on which
							athletes were the best. I hadn't taken a single sick day or
							personal day over my first year with the company and was starting
							to experience a bit of burnout, so it was a good decision to take
							a little time off to recover. I also realized how much I'd missed
							coding for fun in my spare time, and now that I was more
							comfortable at work I decided to get back into it. It was a bit of
							a struggle to figure out how much time to dedicate in the
							mornings, evenings, and weekends without risking my mental acuity
							at work, but I quickly found the right balance.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Over the prior several months Filipe had been tasked with updating
							the app from Angular.js to Angular 2+, but without any success.
							Generally he would spend a few weeks trying an approach which a
							blog post recommended, then come back and tell us that it wouldn't
							work for one reason or another. My suspicion was that he was not
							actually trying in good faith. Eventually it was decided that we
							would incorporate a more modern framework without doing a total
							rewrite, so he began creating an Angular 9 app and I created a
							React one. When we compared them, my boss felt that React was the
							way to go, so we moved forward with that. I've written about the
							way in which React was incorporated
							<a href="../react-html-elements/">here</a>. This was the most
							advanced code I'd worked on at the time and is still one of my
							proudest accomplishments.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Next up was an improvement to the way features were gated. Over
							the previous years there had been several disjointed attempts at
							setting up user tiers and strategies for controlling access to
							certain modules and widgets, but the requirements of a massive new
							client necessitated a more granular and consolidated system. The
							decision was made to add permission overrides like
							"disable_checkout_button" and "hide_shopping_cart," and I regret
							not advocating more strongly for denying access by default and
							only granting it when a flag was present. Our experiences with
							leaks over the following years would only reinforce this basic
							principle: it's better to grant only the smallest possible amount
							of access by default.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							As this point it was decided that we would expand the pool of
							vendors, so we added a new feature which we referred to as
							External Vendors. This was an incredibly complex undertaking which
							required a major reworking of the PDP and various other modules,
							and marked the first time that I had to make large changes to code
							which I myself had written in the first place. While it was
							certainly less painful than other similar endeavors, I was amazed
							at how much I'd improved since writing the original code, but also
							frequently pleased to note that a decision I'd made at the time
							with extensibility in mind was now proving to have been the
							correct call.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							We welcomed a new team member named Ana in the spring, and she and
							I began working on incorporating unit tests into the React repo.
							She immediately proved herself to be a skilled and hardworking
							person, and I was overjoyed to finally have a fellow frontend dev
							who was as reliable and committed as I was. We began making great
							strides, and for the first month or two after she joined the team
							I noticed Filipe's performance improving as well, as he was likely
							concerned that he was being replaced.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Over the summer it was decided that the company would add an
							entirely new feature called Patient Workflows. This constituted an
							expansion from managing dental inventory to a broader focus
							encompassing the digitization and consolidation of everything
							which goes into running a successful practice (patient records,
							communication with specialists, and so on). It was an insanely
							large amount of work, and Ana and I both put in well over 60 hours
							per week for months on end. I can't imagine how it would have gone
							without her, but it was an extremely rewarding experience as we
							spurred each other on and were able to truly collaborate. I
							finally got to see how programming as a team is meant to be, and
							for the first time we were provided with a green field in which to
							work using React and TypeScript.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I was promoted to Senior Frontend Engineer in February 2023, which
							my boss acknowledged was really more of a recognition of the role
							I'd already been playing for the previous year. I felt tremendous
							pride in this accomplishment.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							As a result of my promotion several key team members felt
							comfortable coming to me and expressing concern about Filipe's
							lack of effort. It had always been a sort of unspoken
							understanding, but recent performance issues had become so
							problematic as to warrant immediate action. We decided that it
							needed to be elevated to the CTO. Filipe was given numerous
							opportunities to improve his output over the next several months,
							but was unwilling or unable to do so. After being placed on a
							performance improvement plan and still failing to meet the
							reasonable requirements which had been clearly communicated, he
							was informed that he would be removed from the team in three
							months' time. He decided to resign immediately instead.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							As one would expect, Filipe's departure instantly proved to be
							addition by subtraction. No more did Ana and I have to take on a
							bunch of new tickets days before each staging build was due. No
							more were entire features punted from sprints multiple times.
							Everything ran much more smoothly now that the entire team was
							honorable and industrious. I liked him personally, as did we all,
							but at a certain point a clear eyed assessment of value added
							needs to occur.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I spent two years as Senior Frontend Engineer, and during that
							time the workforce gradually contracted from a peak of nearly 30
							employees back down to 12. This meant I needed to contribute much
							more to product decisions than ever before, and to improve my
							leadership skills. In addition to continuing to be a prolific
							individual contributor, I also took a lead role in the hiring
							process and in mentoring junior developers and interns. In my
							spare time I continued to work on my portfolio/blog and its
							featured projects, including the personal websites of my
							girlfriend and my mom along with the final versions of maxWellness
							and GoatVote.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Almost exactly four years after I joined the team, my position was
							impacted by layoffs. It was not a total surprise, as I had been
							privy to certain financial discussions, but it's never easy to say
							goodbye to your colleagues. I'll be eternally grateful for my time
							at Sowingo, it was just about the best experience I could have
							hoped for to start my career.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Since then I've focused largely on creating new blog posts and
							working on my passion projects, but I've also attempted to take a
							bit of a sabbatical in order to focus on my health and well-being.
							A much needed trip to San Diego marked the first time I've left
							Canada in nearly a decade, and I've also been able to invest more
							energy into my hobbies of weightlifting and playing bass guitar.
							I'm excited to see what the future holds!
