              This past Wednesday marked the 102nd anniversary of the signing of
              the armistice which brought the First World War to an end. We in
              the Anglosphere use this occasion every year to commemorate and
              honour our veterans and fallen heroes. The holiday is known as
              Armistice Day in the UK, Veterans Day in the USA, and Remembrance
              Day here in Canada. I always take a moment of silence at 11:00am
              (the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month) to
              reflect on the sacrifices of my forbearers and the millions of
              others who endured unimaginable hardships to protect the liberties
              we enjoy today.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              My sister and I refer to our paternal grandparents as Nanny and
              Poppy, and both were involved in World War Two. Nanny was a Rosie
              the Riveter, building munitions at a factory in her native Ottawa.
              Poppy was born and raised in London, and during the Battle of
              Britain he risked his life nightly to help extinguish fires set by
              the incendiary bombs of the Luftwaffe. His grandparents and one of
              his aunts were killed during the Blitz when a German bomb
              collapsed our family's ancestral home.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Poppy was later drafted into the British Army and served in Italy
              until the end of the war. He fought in the famous Battle of Monte
              Cassino, during which he and many of his compatriots were pinned
              under a train for three days by enemy fire. They eventually
              prevailed and broke through the Axis line, all but assuring the
              capture of Rome. This victory was absolutely crucial to ensuring
              the defeat of Mussolini and his Nazi allies, and I'm proud of the
              part my grandfather played in it.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Poppy didn't like to talk much about the war, but he did tell me a
              few stories when I asked him about it as a boy. The retreating
              German and Italian forces were notorious for setting booby traps,
              and one of Poppy's friends was blown up right in front of him
              while attempting to claim a trophy from a dead enemy combatant. He
              also recounted that during the final week of the war he'd lost
              another good friend whom he described as one of the finest men
              he'd ever met. Even more tragic than the timing is that this man
              was killed by friendly fire.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Last summer my Uncle Robert told me a story that Poppy never
              shared with anyone but his wife, but which Nanny told Robert after
              my grandfather passed away. Poppy was scouting ahead of his unit
              one day and came around a hedgerow at the same time that a German
              soldier was coming around the other side of it. Both men raised
              their rifles but Poppy shot first, hitting the Nazi in the
              stomach. Immediately overcome with guilt, Poppy lay down next to
              the young man as he bled out, attempting to provide him comfort
              and giving him a sip from his canteen when the German asked for
              "wasser." When the other Britons arrived, they placed the injured
              man on a stretcher and took him back to a field hospital, where he
              died of his wound. Poppy looked through the dead soldier's wallet
              and saw pictures of his wife and children. Nanny said that Poppy
              had nightmares about it for the rest of his life. He took the
              man's belt buckle as a reminder, passing it down to my father, who
              passed it down to me. It's engraved with the image of an eagle
              perched on a swastika, surrounded by German writing. I never knew
              the story behind it until my uncle told me, but it has now taken
              on even more meaning for me. I don't know how many men he killed
              or friends he lost, but I can't imagine how hard it must have been
              for my Poppy to live a normal life after what he'd seen and done
              in the war. He was considerably younger at the time than I am now.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              My mother's parents also made great sacrifices to protect our way
              of life from the forces of evil. My Grandma was a girl during the
              war and her father enlisted in the Canadian military, despite
              already being in his thirties and the patriarch of a family of
              four. He was killed in action in Italy, and I don't think my
              Grandma ever really got over it. The telegram to my Nana said that
              her husband was killed instantly when a piece of shrapnel from an
              enemy mortar struck him in the heart, but I've always wondered if
              that was a sugarcoated version of the truth intended to help
              assuage the grief of a war widow. Nana wondered that too.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              My Grandpa was from Massachusetts and he enlisted in the United
              States Army Air Force in 1942, at the age of 19. He served as the
              radar operator of a B-29 Super Fortress and took part in 31
              bombing raids in the South Pacific. The most infamous of these was
              Operation Meetinghouse, a massive assault on Tokyo which resulted
              in over 100,000 Japanese deaths, over a million casualties, and
              over a million people displaced from their homes. The vast
              majority of these victims were civilians, and Grandpa was burdened
              with guilt until the end of his life. He was triggered badly in
              1992 after reading a biography of President Truman which went into
              detail about Operation Meetinghouse and described how terrible it
              was to be killed by napalm. Most of the missions he took part in
              were directed at military industrial targets, but he did also
              participate in the single deadliest night of bombing in the most
              bloody war in human history. It's common to justify this attrition
              by pointing out how much worse a land invasion of Japan would have
              been (especially if Stalin had invaded from the north), but I
              can't imagine that this was very comforting to the men like my
              grandfather who had to carry out the gruesome orders.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Grandpa received many medals for his service, although he didn't
              really seem to care about them at all. He'd show them to me any
              time I asked, and my favourite was his Purple Heart. He'd received
              it after being shot just above the hip by a bullet which passed
              right through him and continued to ricochet around the fuselage of
              his plane, hitting two of his fellow airmen. The scar from the
              entry wound was almost perfectly round and about the size of a
              nickel, but the exit wound in his lower back was oblong and about
              the size of a baseball. Small pieces of the projectile were lodged
              in his body for some time after the war, and he'd occasionally
              sweat them out during the two years of night terrors he endured
              after returning to the States.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Grandpa was like Poppy and most other vets in that he almost never
              spoke about his experiences in the war, although he would describe
              in general terms how awful it was to have lunch with a friend and
              then find out that evening that he had been shot down. This was a
              common occurrence, since Grandpa's was one of the only planes in
              his squadron to make it through the war. He also told me that he'd
              had one final brush with death after his discharge, when he saw a
              torpedo narrowly miss the hull of the transport ship taking him to
              the safety of San Francisco. It's indicative of the pervasive
              racism of the day that he remembered officers informing the cadets
              during basic training that Japanese pilots lacked both peripheral
              and night vision due to their "slanty" eyes.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Grandpa would sometimes tell me stories he'd heard from friends in
              the infantry, as I imagine it was easier to discuss the things he
              hadn't experienced first hand. Marines told him grisly tales about
              discovering Japanese soldiers who'd committed harakiri, a
              ritualistic suicide in which one stabs oneself in the torso.
              Surrender was absolutely out of the question for the Imperial
              Army, and Japanese snipers would tie themselves to their treetop
              perches so as to keep fighting even when mortally wounded. Most
              disturbing of all is that at one point a group of enemy soldiers
              had run out of bullets and was holed up in a network of caves with
              swords and bayonets ready, so the USMC had to go in with
              flamethrowers to take them out. The soldier who told my Grandpa
              the story described it as "barbecuing ‘em."
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              My Aunt Susan recently requested and was granted access to my
              Grandpa's war records, and only then did we learn specific details
              of his time fighting the Empire of the Sun. He'd received his
              Distinguished Flying Cross after his plane heroically descended to
              unsafe heights in order to protect a compromised American
              aircraft. We also discovered that during the mission in which he
              was wounded, his plane had been badly damaged by anti-aircraft
              fire and then had to fly more than a thousand miles over the ocean
              in order to safely return to American-held territory. The island
              on which they were forced to land before returning to their base
              on Saipan had only recently been captured, and Grandpa was forever
              haunted by the appearance and stench of mounds of dead bodies
              piled high on the sides of the runway.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Several years after the war, my Grandpa was in a bar in New York
              when he recognized a fighter pilot friend of his who'd been shot
              down and declared missing in action, presumed killed in action. It
              turned out that he miraculously survived after crashing into the
              ocean and treading water, waiting to die of exposure or for a
              shark to kill him. After a short while, a submarine suddenly
              surfaced nearby and a sailer opened the hatch, jokingly asking him
              if he needed a lift. There were only two American subs in the
              entire Pacific Ocean, so the odds of one of them having seen his
              plane crash were astronomically small. It's also incredible that
              my grandfather happened to be in the same bar at the same time in
              the late 1940s.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              Grandpa's brother Cesar was also in the war. He lost 15 pounds due
              to seasickness and anxiety as he crossed the Atlantic, then served
              as a corpsman while Allied forces pushed the Third Reich all the
              way from Normandy to Berlin. He always ducked questions about his
              time overseas by joking that he'd found the biggest tree in Europe
              and hidden behind it, although I've cleaned up the language a bit.
              My great-grandmother was a devout Catholic and must have nearly
              worn her rosary to dust as she prayed for the safe return of her
              two youngest sons. Grandpa lost his faith in the war (along with
              his taste for coconut and pineapple), but he never let his mother
              know.

              Nearly everyone I grew up with is descended from people whose
              lives were turned upside down by the Second World War. My aunt's
              father was from Yugoslavia, and when Germany invaded he was sent
              into the woods to camp out with the town's horses in order to
              prevent them from being commandeered by the Nazis. When he
              returned to his village, it had been levelled and everyone was
              gone. He was 9 years old at the time, and spent the next few years
              wandering Europe and surviving by his wits. He finally landed in a
              displaced persons camp and then met his future wife on the boat
              over to Canada. She was the daughter of an enthusiastic member of
              the Nazi Party in Germany, and even in her 80s I don't think she's
              ever been able to reconcile that.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-paragraph">
              My next door neighbours when I was young became some of our
              closest family friends, and still are to this day. They're Jewish,
              and are descended on both sides from Holocaust survivors. Evelyn's
              Romanian parents were married to other people prior to the war and
              each had children, but tragically both were sent to Auschwitz and
              lost their entire families. They got married after the war before
              moving to New York and having Evelyn. Her father was grateful for
              every subsequent moment of his life, as he had resigned himself to
              dying in the camps and now treated every day with his new wife and
              daughter as a treasured gift. Her mother, on the other hand, was
              understandably utterly miserable for the entire remainder of her
              very long life, constantly fretting about the safety of her
              daughter and, eventually, her grandsons. Evelyn has never been
              able to bring herself to watch any Holocaust movies, and tries to
              avoid any topic of conversation which could remind her of her
              murdered brothers and sisters. Her husband is named George, and
              his parents were members of the French resistance. At one point,
              his father was captured by the enemy. George's mother spoke fluent
              German, so she dressed as a maid and infiltrated Nazi headquarters
              to bust her husband out. If you pitched that story (or the story
              of my Grandpa's friend and the submarine) to Hollywood movie
              producers, they would tell you that it was too unbelievable.
              Sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction, and the crucible
              of WWII produced some of the most remarkable stories I've ever
              heard, along with some of the most horrifying cruelty and
              suffering humanity has ever perpetrated.

              My grandparents have sadly all passed away, but they still live on
              in the memories of those of us who love them. This is lamentably
              not true of my great-grandfather, since he gave his life for his
              country more than 75 years ago and no one who knew him is still
              alive today. That is one of the main reasons it's essential for us
              to commemorate heroes like him on Remembrance Day; for every story
              passed down by soldiers, there are many more that die with them.
              Because he was killed long before any of his grandchildren were
              born, we don't even have a moniker for David Cameron and I can
              only refer to him by name or as mom's grandfather, Grandma's dad,
              or Nana's husband. This will be true of my father as well, and I
              can't help but wonder if the anxious uncertainty of his battle
              with cancer and the pain of his eventual death were at all similar
              to what my grandmother and great aunt experienced while their dad
              was overseas. It's important for us to acknowledge that it was not
              only the soldiers themselves who were impacted by the horrifying
              realities of combat; whether they were lost forever or returned as
              broken husks of the men they once were, the lingering aftereffects
              of their suffering continue to ripple through generations of their
              families.

              Even in tumultuous times like those in which we currently find
              ourselves, we must resolve not to lose perspective. The Greatest
              Generation had to endure the Depression and then wage a protracted
              war against fascist imperial forces despite overwhelming odds.
              Millions of young men like my grandfathers sacrificed their
              innocence, their faith, and their mental health to ensure that
              freedom would not be lost from the face of the Earth, and millions
              more like my great-grandfather gave their lives. I wouldn't be
              here today if my Poppy hadn't fired before that German soldier
              could shoot him, or if the bullet that hit my Grandpa had been a
              foot higher or six inches to the left. Both men risked their lives
              for years on end, and I'll never stop feeling grateful that they
              made it home. Nor will I ever forget the importance of the victory
              they achieved at an unimaginable cost.
