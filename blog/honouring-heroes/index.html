						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							This past Wednesday marked the 102nd anniversary of the signing of
							the armistice which brought the First World War to an end. We in
							the Anglosphere use this occasion every year to commemorate and
							honour our veterans and fallen heroes. The holiday is known as
							Armistice Day in the UK, Veterans Day in the USA, and Remembrance
							Day here in Canada. I always take a moment of silence at 11:00am
							(the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month) to
							reflect on the sacrifices of my forbearers and the millions of
							others who endured unimaginable hardships to protect the liberties
							we enjoy today.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My sister and I refer to our paternal grandparents as Nanny and
							Poppy, and both were involved in World War Two. Nanny was a Rosie
							the Riveter, building munitions at a factory in her native Ottawa.
							Poppy was born and raised in London, and during the Battle of
							Britain he risked his life nightly to help extinguish fires set by
							the incendiary bombs of the Luftwaffe. His grandparents and one of
							his aunts were killed during the Blitz when a German bomb
							collapsed our family's ancestral home.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Poppy was later drafted into the British Army and served in Italy
							until the end of the war. He fought in the famous Battle of Monte
							Cassino, during which he and many of his compatriots were pinned
							under a train for three days by enemy fire. They eventually
							prevailed and broke through the Axis line, all but assuring the
							capture of Rome. This victory was absolutely crucial to ensuring
							the defeat of Mussolini and his Nazi allies, and I'm proud of the
							part my grandfather played in it.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Poppy didn't like to talk much about the war, but he did tell me a
							few stories when I asked him about it as a boy. The retreating
							German and Italian forces were notorious for setting booby traps,
							and one of Poppy's friends was blown up right in front of him
							while attempting to claim a trophy from a dead enemy combatant. He
							also recounted that during the final week of the war he'd lost
							another good friend whom he described as one of the finest men
							he'd ever met. Even more tragic than the timing is that this man
							was killed by friendly fire.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Last summer my Uncle Robert told me a story that Poppy never
							shared with anyone but his wife, but which Nanny told Robert after
							my grandfather passed away. Poppy was scouting ahead of his unit
							one day and came around a hedgerow at the same time that a German
							soldier was coming around the other side of it. Both men raised
							their rifles but Poppy shot first, hitting the Nazi in the
							stomach. Immediately overcome with guilt, Poppy lay down next to
							the young man as he bled out, attempting to provide him comfort
							and giving him a sip from his canteen when the German asked for
							"wasser." When the other Britons arrived, they placed the injured
							man on a stretcher and took him back to a field hospital, where he
							died of his wound. Poppy looked through the dead soldier's wallet
							and saw pictures of his wife and children. Nanny said that Poppy
							had nightmares about it for the rest of his life. He took the
							man's belt buckle as a reminder, passing it down to my father, who
							passed it down to me. It's engraved with the image of an eagle
							perched on a swastika, surrounded by German writing. I never knew
							the story behind it until my uncle told me, but it has now taken
							on even more meaning for me. I don't know how many men he killed
							or friends he lost, but I can't imagine how hard it must have been
							for my Poppy to live a normal life after what he'd seen and done
							in the war. He was considerably younger at the time than I am now.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My mother's parents also made great sacrifices to protect our way
							of life from the forces of evil. My Grandma was a girl during the
							war and her father enlisted in the Canadian military, despite
							already being in his thirties and the patriarch of a family of
							four. He was killed in action in Italy, and I don't think my
							Grandma ever really got over it. The telegram to my Nana said that
							her husband was killed instantly when a piece of shrapnel from an
							enemy mortar struck him in the heart, but I've always wondered if
							that was a sugarcoated version of the truth intended to help
							assuage the grief of a war widow. Nana wondered that too.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My Grandpa was from Massachusetts and he enlisted in the United
							States Army Air Force in 1942, at the age of 19. He served as the
							radar operator of a B-29 Super Fortress and took part in 31
							bombing raids in the South Pacific. The most infamous of these was
							Operation Meetinghouse, a massive assault on Tokyo which resulted
							in over 100,000 Japanese deaths, over a million casualties, and
							over a million people displaced from their homes. The vast
							majority of these victims were civilians, and Grandpa was burdened
							with guilt until the end of his life. He was triggered badly in
							1992 after reading a biography of President Truman which went into
							detail about Operation Meetinghouse and described how terrible it
							was to be killed by napalm. Most of the missions he took part in
							were directed at military industrial targets, but he did also
							participate in the single deadliest night of bombing in the most
							bloody war in human history. It's common to justify this attrition
							by pointing out how much worse a land invasion of Japan would have
							been (especially if Stalin had invaded from the north), but I
							can't imagine that this was very comforting to the men like my
							grandfather who had to carry out the gruesome orders.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Grandpa received many medals for his service, although he didn't
							really seem to care about them at all. He'd show them to me any
							time I asked, and my favourite was his Purple Heart. He'd received
							it after being shot just above the hip by a bullet which passed
							right through him and continued to ricochet around the fuselage of
							his plane, hitting two of his fellow airmen. The scar from the
							entry wound was almost perfectly round and about the size of a
							nickel, but the exit wound in his lower back was oblong and about
							the size of a baseball. Small pieces of the projectile were lodged
							in his body for some time after the war, and he'd occasionally
							sweat them out during the two years of night terrors he endured
							after returning to the States.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Grandpa was like Poppy and most other vets in that he almost never
							spoke about his experiences in the war, although he would describe
							in general terms how awful it was to have lunch with a friend and
							then find out that evening that he had been shot down. This was a
							common occurrence, since Grandpa's was one of the only planes in
							his squadron to make it through the war. He also told me that he'd
							had one final brush with death after his discharge, when he saw a
							torpedo narrowly miss the hull of the transport ship taking him to
							the safety of San Francisco. It's indicative of the pervasive
							racism of the day that he remembered officers informing the cadets
							during basic training that Japanese pilots lacked both peripheral
							and night vision due to their "slanty" eyes.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Grandpa would sometimes tell me stories he'd heard from friends in
							the infantry, as I imagine it was easier to discuss the things he
							hadn't experienced first hand. Marines told him grisly tales about
							discovering Japanese soldiers who'd committed harakiri, a
							ritualistic suicide in which one stabs oneself in the torso.
							Surrender was absolutely out of the question for the Imperial
							Army, and Japanese snipers would tie themselves to their treetop
							perches so as to keep fighting even when mortally wounded. Most
							disturbing of all is that at one point a group of enemy soldiers
							had run out of bullets and was holed up in a network of caves with
							swords and bayonets ready, so the USMC had to go in with
							flamethrowers to take them out. The soldier who told my Grandpa
							the story described it as "barbecuing 'em."
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My Aunt Susan recently requested and was granted access to my
							Grandpa's war records, and only then did we learn specific details
							of his time fighting the Empire of the Sun. He'd received his
							Distinguished Flying Cross after his plane heroically descended to
							unsafe heights in order to protect a compromised American
							aircraft. We also discovered that during the mission in which he
							was wounded, his plane had been badly damaged by anti-aircraft
							fire and then had to fly more than a thousand miles over the ocean
							in order to safely return to American-held territory. The island
							on which they were forced to land before returning to their base
							on Saipan had only recently been captured, and Grandpa was forever
							haunted by the appearance and stench of mounds of dead bodies
							piled high on the sides of the runway.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Several years after the war, my Grandpa was in a bar in New York
							when he recognized a fighter pilot friend of his who'd been shot
							down and declared missing in action, presumed killed in action. It
							turned out that he miraculously survived after crashing into the
							ocean and treading water, waiting to die of exposure or for a
							shark to kill him. After a short while, a submarine suddenly
							surfaced nearby and a sailer opened the hatch, jokingly asking him
							if he needed a lift. There were only two American subs in the
							entire Pacific Ocean, so the odds of one of them having seen his
							plane crash were astronomically small. It's also incredible that
							my grandfather happened to be in the same bar at the same time in
							the late 1940s.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Grandpa's brother Cesar was also in the war. He lost 15 pounds due
							to seasickness and anxiety as he crossed the Atlantic, then served
							as a corpsman while Allied forces pushed the Third Reich all the
							way from Normandy to Berlin. He always ducked questions about his
							time overseas by joking that he'd found the biggest tree in Europe
							and hidden behind it, although I've cleaned up the language a bit.
							My great-grandmother was a devout Catholic and must have nearly
							worn her rosary to dust as she prayed for the safe return of her
							two youngest sons. Grandpa lost his faith in the war (along with
							his taste for coconut and pineapple), but he never let his mother
							know.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Nearly everyone I grew up with is descended from people whose
							lives were turned upside down by the Second World War. My aunt's
							father was from Yugoslavia, and when Germany invaded he was sent
							into the woods to camp out with the town's horses in order to
							prevent them from being commandeered by the Nazis. When he
							returned to his village, it had been levelled and everyone was
							gone. He was 9 years old at the time, and spent the next few years
							wandering Europe and surviving by his wits. He finally landed in a
							displaced persons camp and then met his future wife on the boat
							over to Canada. She was the daughter of an enthusiastic member of
							the Nazi Party in Germany, and even in her 80s I don't think she's
							ever been able to reconcile that.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My next door neighbours when I was young became some of our
							closest family friends, and still are to this day. They're Jewish,
							and are descended on both sides from Holocaust survivors. Evelyn's
							Romanian parents were married to other people prior to the war and
							each had children, but tragically both were sent to Auschwitz and
							lost their entire families. They got married after the war before
							moving to New York and having Evelyn. Her father was grateful for
							every subsequent moment of his life, as he had resigned himself to
							dying in the camps and now treated every day with his new wife and
							daughter as a treasured gift. Her mother, on the other hand, was
							understandably utterly miserable for the entire remainder of her
							very long life, constantly fretting about the safety of her
							daughter and, eventually, her grandsons. Evelyn has never been
							able to bring herself to watch any Holocaust movies, and tries to
							avoid any topic of conversation which could remind her of her
							murdered brothers and sisters. Her husband is named George, and
							his parents were members of the French resistance. At one point,
							his father was captured by the enemy. George's mother spoke fluent
							German, so she dressed as a maid and infiltrated Nazi headquarters
							to bust her husband out. If you pitched that story (or the story
							of my Grandpa's friend and the submarine) to Hollywood movie
							producers, they would tell you that it was too unbelievable.
							Sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction, and the crucible
							of WWII produced some of the most remarkable stories I've ever
							heard, along with some of the most horrifying cruelty and
							suffering humanity has ever perpetrated.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My grandparents have sadly all passed away, but they still live on
							in the memories of those of us who love them. This is lamentably
							not true of my great-grandfather, since he gave his life for his
							country more than 75 years ago and no one who knew him is still
							alive today. That is one of the main reasons it's essential for us
							to commemorate heroes like him on Remembrance Day; for every story
							passed down by soldiers, there are many more that die with them.
							Because he was killed long before any of his grandchildren were
							born, we don't even have a moniker for David Cameron and I can
							only refer to him by name or as mom's grandfather, Grandma's dad,
							or Nana's husband. This will be true of my father as well, and I
							can't help but wonder if the anxious uncertainty of his battle
							with cancer and the pain of his eventual death were at all similar
							to what my grandmother and great aunt experienced while their dad
							was overseas. It's important for us to acknowledge that it was not
							only the soldiers themselves who were impacted by the horrifying
							realities of combat; whether they were lost forever or returned as
							broken husks of the men they once were, the lingering aftereffects
							of their suffering continue to ripple through generations of their
							families.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Even in tumultuous times like those in which we currently find
							ourselves, we must resolve not to lose perspective. The Greatest
							Generation had to endure the Depression and then wage a protracted
							war against fascist imperial forces despite overwhelming odds.
							Millions of young men like my grandfathers sacrificed their
							innocence, their faith, and their mental health to ensure that
							freedom would not be lost from the face of the Earth, and millions
							more like my great-grandfather gave their lives. I wouldn't be
							here today if my Poppy hadn't fired before that German soldier
							could shoot him, or if the bullet that hit my Grandpa had been a
							foot higher or six inches to the left. Both men risked their lives
							for years on end, and I'll never stop feeling grateful that they
							made it home. Nor will I ever forget the importance of the victory
							they achieved at an unimaginable cost.
