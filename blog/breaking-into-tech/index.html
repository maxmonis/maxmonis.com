						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I haven't posted here in over two years because I've been too busy
							with my new career to find much time to write. I'd like to begin
							blogging again (albeit less frequently than once per week as I did
							before), and reflecting on my transition from amateur coder to
							professional web developer seemed like a perfect place to start.
							It's been almost five years since I wrote my first lines of code
							and a lot has changed since then, culminating with my being
							promoted to Senior Frontend Engineer earlier this month.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							<a href="../learning-to-code" rel="noreferrer"
								>My first article</a
							>
							illuminates the process I used to learn to code, and within
							roughly six months of beginning that undertaking I had acquired
							the requisite skills for an entry-level position in frontend web
							development. I began applying every day to as many jobs as
							possible, but to no avail. By the time I had built this personal
							website and blog, the better part of a year had passed since I
							began to apply. I had nothing to show for it save for a handful of
							preliminary phone interviews with recruiters and human resources
							personnel, and it was growing increasingly difficult to keep
							doubts from creeping into my mind.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							In retrospect, I think the main reason for this lack of success
							was that I was somewhat insecure about my knowledge and
							proficiency, and as a result was overly eager to use the most
							technical terms possible. This was not wise because if I was
							talking to a non-technical person, they were unable to follow what
							I was saying or verify if it was accurate. Conversely, if I was
							talking to a technical person, I was revealing the vast
							limitations of my current knowledge. That second point is only
							obvious in hindsight, as I didn't fully realize at the time how
							much greater my understanding of programming could and would
							become.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I continued to diligently apply for jobs and work on improving my
							portfolio, and in November of 2020 I finally did well enough in a
							phone interview that I was sent a take-home programming challenge.
							It specified that I needed to use Angular.js, which is an outdated
							framework with which I had no previous experience. I was overjoyed
							at the opportunity and got right to work.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Within hours, disaster struck. My computer suddenly shut down and
							refused to turn back on. This was extremely disheartening, as was
							the $400 quote I received when I took it to a repair specialist
							the following morning (this misfortune is another reason I
							abruptly stopped blogging that November). Fortunately, I had
							recently begun to date a young woman named Andrea, and she lent me
							her old Acer computer. Writing code on it was out of the question
							since it barely worked at all, but at least I could get online
							using a bigger screen than my phone.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I spent all day Thursday and Friday learning as much as possible
							about Angular.js, then drove to Andrea's apartment in Etobicoke,
							where we had already planned for me to spend the weekend. She
							generously allowed me to download Visual Studio Code onto her
							MacBook, and I spent virtually every waking moment of both days
							working on the challenge. I still have my solution on Github and
							it makes me laugh whenever I look at it, as my inexperience at the
							time is painfully obvious.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I submitted the code on Monday morning just before the deadline,
							along with a brief explanation of the issues which had stemmed
							from my laptop short-circuiting. I had debated neglecting to
							mention the situation at all (since it could appear that I was
							simply fabricating excuses to explain away my poor performance on
							the challenge), but I know now that including this information was
							definitely the right decision - my boss told me recently that my
							having persisted despite that adversity was a key factor in his
							decision to move me on to the next stage of the interview process.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Next up was a Zoom call with the founders of the company. Paul
							(the CEO) and Wayne (the CTO) immediately struck me as extremely
							smart and kind people, and the way they described the culture they
							wanted to foster also deeply resonated with me. The company is
							called Sowingo and is a Toronto-based eCommerce and SaaS startup
							in the dental space. Paul is an oral surgeon and founded the
							company because he saw the need for better digitization of
							inventory and medical records, and since then the scope has
							greatly expanded to also include procurement.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Following the technical interview, I was invited to come meet the
							two of them in person. Andrea felt sure that this meant I had the
							job, but I didn't want to jinx it (despite the obvious added
							weight imbued to an in-person meeting at the height of a global
							pandemic). Sure enough, I was offered the position and eagerly
							accepted.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My first three weeks were a blur as I acclimated myself not only
							to the codebase but also to the processes which come along with
							programming as part of a team. I had always simply pushed to a
							"master" branch on the Github repos of all my portfolio projects,
							and now had to greatly improve my understanding of Git. I also had
							to get up to speed with regard to a number of tools like Jira and
							Slack which I'd never used before. The learning curve was steep,
							but by the time we got back from Christmas break I had the basics
							down.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The first major undertaking was localizing the application, since
							we had designs on entering the untapped and overwhelmingly
							francophone Quebec market. Doing so was an incredibly tedious and
							time-consuming process, but it was also a great way for me to
							learn more about how the code was structured and where different
							modules lived. I worked closely with the QA and customer success
							team during the process and developed great working relationships
							with them.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The first iteration of localization took a few months to complete,
							and next I was tasked with building the new Product Details Page.
							This major feature is a crucial part of the checkout flow, and
							working through the specifications with the designer, product
							manager, and backend devs was extremely beneficial when it came to
							my ability to think as an engineer instead of merely as a coder.
							I've worked on many features with equivalent utility and greater
							complexity since then, but the PDP will always hold a special
							place in my heart as the first major feature I built.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The team and I continued to roll out new features over the
							remainder of my first year on the job, and my predominant
							secondary focus became modernizing the application - we were still
							using Angular.js with es5 and had absolutely no unit testing.
							Fortunately, we were able to incorporate Karma and Jasmine and set
							up a rudimentary CI/CD pipeline. No one at the company had any
							experience with TDD, so we had to figure it out together as we
							went. This is one of my favourite things about working at a
							startup: everyone is necessarily a generalist. I've had many
							opportunities to spearhead initiatives, along with the freedom to
							make mistakes so we can learn from them. At many larger companies
							I wouldn't have even been in the meetings where senior developers
							discussed these decisions.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							We had initially hoped to migrate the codebase from Angular.js to
							Angular 2+, and had a few false starts which wound up not bearing
							fruit. We finally decided to instead use a submodule-based
							approach, and I began working on a new React app. I love React and
							use it almost exclusively in the applications I build for fun, so
							I was very excited to begin using it professionally as well. Our
							plan for migration is best analogized using the Ship of Theseus:
							replacing one rotten Angular.js board at a time with a fresh React
							one.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Wayne and I worked closely together scoping out the initial
							implementation of the submodule. We'd never used TypeScript or
							esLint but had seen first-hand the issues which can arise from the
							lack thereof, so I began configuring both. I also wrote extensive
							documentation about our standards, and built a proprietary
							abstraction layer for making API requests using Axios.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The most challenging part of creating the submodule was achieving
							interoperability with the existing Angular application (since we
							didn't have enough manpower to rewrite the entire app and then
							port over). I found a blog post describing how to create HTML
							elements which were React components under the hood, and tailored
							it to our needs by incorporating Angular directives. We've made
							minor adjustments to it since then but it's proven to be an
							excellent solution, and one of my coworkers thinks I should submit
							a talk to ReactConf explaining how it works. I may do so, as
							undoubtedly many companies are paying the same technical debt as
							us and would benefit from our hard-won knowledge.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Since then my grasp of TypeScript has improved exponentially and I
							now really do prefer it to the dynamically typed mayhem of JS.
							Incorporating tools like Mock Service Worker and React Query has
							also been extremely fun and educational, and using a modern stack
							has made the entire development process more engaging, rewarding,
							and enjoyable. I've become the goto person when it comes to BDD,
							and a goal for this year is to continue to improve my
							understanding of e2e testing with Cypress.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							On a personal note, Andrea and I have been living together for the
							past year and a half in a lovely apartment in a quiet East York
							neighbourhood. We own our own home gym, I can play bass in the
							attic without bothering anyone else, and we're lucky enough to
							both work from home. I count these blessings and many more each
							day. It's amazing how much my life has improved in a few short
							years, and it was all made possible by computer programming and
							the love of a good woman.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I'm in a senior role and the team has more than doubled in size
							since I joined, so my responsibilities at work have greatly
							expanded. I have even less spare time and mental bandwidth than
							previously, but programming hasn't lost an ounce of joy for me and
							I still work on my side projects whenever I get the chance. In
							much the same way that I continued to play bass for fun when I was
							a professional musician and lift weights in my spare time when I
							worked as a personal trainer, I feel blessed to have a career
							that's also a hobby and a passion.
