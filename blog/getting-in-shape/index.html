						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							When I was 23 my mom fell mysteriously ill and I moved home to
							small town Canada to help support her, having been unsuccessfully
							pursuing a career as a songwriter and bassist in Los Angeles for
							some time. Acknowledging at long last that I was unlikely to ever
							make it in the music industry was emotionally devastating, and
							trying to decide who I was if I wasn't an artist seemed incredibly
							daunting. I had nothing to fall back on and nothing else
							interested me.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Adding to this turmoil was my overwhelming concern for the
							wellbeing of my mother. As a child I'd lost my dad to cancer a
							week shy of his fortieth birthday, and the resultant PTSD had left
							me ill-equipped to deal with adversity of any kind. What's more, I
							had a hard time believing that my remaining parent would be able
							to pull through this time. I was utterly miserable and constantly
							fretted about things I couldn't control. I missed California
							terribly.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I began overeating as a result of this distress and in less than
							four months had ballooned to 220 pounds, giving myself unsightly
							stretch marks in the process which I believe to be permanent. I
							felt horrible both physically and emotionally and was painfully
							aware of how unattractive my body had become. I was trapped in a
							vicious cycle where food provided comfort as it exacerbated many
							of the underlying problems which were depressing me.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My wakeup call came when I finally acquiesced to buying new pants,
							having been unable to fit into anything other than sweats for
							months. My waist had been 32 inches since high school but I was
							horrified to discover that I had skipped right over size 34 and
							now could only snugly fit into jeans with a 36 inch waistband. I
							decided to make a change.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I'd never been a gym goer aside from a few brief and uncomfortable
							trial periods, but I knew I had to start exercising. I began
							jogging in the park and forced myself to go every single day,
							despite experiencing crippling knee pain immediately and
							consistently. I also attempted to gradually alter my eating
							habits, but without much success. I still felt awful almost all
							the time but at least now there was one small area of my life
							which I could control and which was positive on balance.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							A few months into my training the weather became too cold for my
							liking, so I joined a local gym and began running on a treadmill
							and doing some rudimentary strength training. I achieved minor
							results very slowly until one day bumping into a friend of mine
							from high school who suggested that I train with him using free
							weights. This would change my life forever. I began lifting
							weights every day, upper body one day and then lower the next, and
							did this consistently for about two years.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							My knees continued to hurt 24/7. I was dealing with at least one
							minor injury at all times and occasionally had to limit my
							training in some way as a result. None of that mattered. I became
							muscular for the first time in my life. I achieved (and have
							maintained ever since) a 30 inch waist, and lost a total of 50
							pounds. My new goals were to bench press 225 pounds and to run a
							marathon.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							By this time my mom had almost fully recovered, having had surgery
							to remove her gall bladder. I, in turn, stopped experiencing
							depression as frequently and acutely. Good fortune had assuaged my
							familial concerns and I had put a ton of effort into improving my
							physical well being, but by most traditional metrics my life was
							still in the toilet. Thankfully, there were concrete ways in which
							I could work to improve my lot.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The first step was finding gainful employment, so I applied for a
							position as a personal trainer. Despite having no experience,
							training, or credentials, they hired me. I had always believed
							that taking a job unrelated to music would cause me to kill myself
							out of frustration, but this fear was quickly proven to be
							baseless. I enjoyed working with clients from all walks of life
							and continued to lift weights every day during my year as a PT,
							learning a lot about fitness and life in the process.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Once I'd saved enough money I moved back to Toronto, where I had
							attended university. I was unimpressed with the vibes of each gym
							where I applied, so I got a day job in the food service industry
							until I could build my own business. I began biking 10 kilometres
							to work each morning, doing manual labour all day, lifting weights
							in the gym in the back of the restaurant, and then biking home. My
							unwillingness to cross town on my days off forced me to reduce my
							weekly workouts from seven to five. Eventually I only lifted
							weights three or four times per week and I took transit or drove
							to work. I had been dead set on exercising every day because I
							worried about backsliding if it became less frequent than that,
							but ultimately every body needs breaks and I had been overdoing
							it. My knees still hurt most of the time.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							After several promotions over the better part of two years, I got
							a job closer to home. Before joining a new gym I purchased a two
							week trial at a local yoga studio and did a 90 minute class each
							day. I enjoyed it immensely, depending on the instructor. A nice
							change of pace.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Once I got back into lifting I began to train every day, using a
							three day split (push, pull, legs). In early 2019 I had my best
							workout ever when I not only bench pressed 225 pounds for the
							first time but also 235. My knees no longer hurt and I had become
							one of the strongest people in the gym, meaning I was
							exponentially stronger than the average person. I had also all but
							completely recovered from my addiction to sugar and fast food.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							On the first warm sunny day of spring I went for a run which I
							estimated to be about five kilometres. It didn't seem overly
							difficult so I booked my spot in the upcoming Toronto marathon. I
							altered my training so that I could run one day and then do upper
							body weightlifting on the next, which proved extremely effective.
							Despite having done no cardio for over a year and then training
							for a mere five weeks, I ran the marathon in 3:54.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Crossing the two biggest fitness goals off of my checklist forced
							me to reassess my priorities. I was tired of constantly having a
							voracious appetite and never seeming to be able to get enough
							sleep. My joints often ached and I felt I was starting to look
							overly bulky. I needed something to focus on other than gaining
							strength. I chose efficiency, as spending nearly 10 hours of each
							week exercising had grown tiresome.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							I began to complete a 40 minute full body training session every
							other day. Inspired in part by legendary bodybuilder Dorian Yates,
							this routine was comprised of one heavy set of eight reps of each
							of my favourite exercises. I did this same exact workout for
							almost a year, with my bodyweight maxing out at 198 pounds after I
							overindulged during Christmas 2019. Then the coronavirus pandemic
							hit and fitness centres were forced to shut down from late March
							to early August.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							By the time I was finally able to start lifting weights again, I
							had fairly uniformly lost about 30% of my strength (for example,
							my bench press 10 rep max dropped from 185 to 135). What's more, I
							had shrivelled to a mere 155 pounds. The only exercise I had done
							in about four months was running, and even that had been hampered
							by bad weather and a lingering foot injury. I had thrown myself
							into my work as a computer programmer and my mental health had
							never been better, but this came at the expense of my physical
							fitness.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							In the ten weeks since the reopening I've worked diligently to
							progressively overload my muscles by gradually lifting heavier and
							heavier weights. I'm happy to report that my shoulders and back
							have fully recovered and my legs are stronger than ever. Chest
							movements have proven slightly more challenging but are almost
							back to where they were. I still only weigh about 175 pounds,
							meaning I've never been stronger pound for pound.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							Yesterday I set my all-time 10 rep personal record for squats.
							Looking at my phone immediately after achieving this mark, my
							heart sank. Several friends had texted to let me know that gyms
							here in the GTA are shutting down again for at least the next 28
							days due to concern about rising cases of covid-19.
						</p>
						<p class="blog-post-paragraph">
							The gym is my sanctuary and I'll miss it immensely, but there's no
							option here other than rolling with the punches. I've purchased a
							kettlebell and have a friend who's planning to get himself an
							olympic bar and some plates, so there's no way I'll be wasting
							away this time around. Depression and chronic pain couldn't stop
							me and neither will this.
